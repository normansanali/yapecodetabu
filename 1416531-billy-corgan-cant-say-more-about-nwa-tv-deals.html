I look forward to announcing those,” Corgan said. “It’s an exciting time, and as you can imagine when those reports came out yeah, the phone started ringing like crazy. Which isn’t a bad thing. That means things are going well.”</p><p>He can’t speak about the specifics on the TV deal. However, Billy Corgan highlights what makes the NWA product unique in a crowded pro wrestling market.</p><h2 id=h-the-wrestling-that-i-grew-up-with>“The wrestling that I grew up with”</h2><p>“Our product is voiced for a casual wrestling fan. And I mean that in a positive way. I think we live in a very complicated society. People don’t always have time to follow every storyline. The greatest compliments I get are from people who grew up watching wrestling with a parent who’s no longer around and, as a result, they’ve lost touch with it. “[NWA] completely rekindled my love of professional wrestling.” The wrestling that I grew up with, you could pop in and out of and easily pick up on who the good guys and bad guys were right away,” Billy Corgan said. “We have people who have never seen a professional wrestling show walk out at the end as fans because it doesn’t require more of them than just having a good time.”</p><p>NWA Samhain takes place on October 28 at TempleLive in Cleveland, Ohio. The event is also available on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FITE</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqbW5rYWKvqrjLsmScp6Kcrq95wpqlrWWjlsZuuc6rnGaZkqTCtXnNsJhmrKZisaaty6w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adam-chance.html><span>←</span><span>Adam Chance</span></a>

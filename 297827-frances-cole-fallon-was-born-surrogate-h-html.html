She showcased her musical talents, appearing on the "At Home Edition" of her dad's show during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p class=dh>Frances Cole Fallon drew her first breath on December 3, 2014, born to Jimmy Fallon and Nancy Juvonen. The now-7-year-old weighed 5 pounds and 11 ounces and measured 18.5 inches in height. However, her parents kept her conception and arrival a secret until after she was born.</p><p class=dh>The day after Frances Cole entered the world, her dad shared a sweet tweet on her behalf, saying she "sends her thanks." The father of two also revealed his nickname for his secondborn, as he affectionately referred to her as "Franny."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Frances Cole Fallon's Parents Did Not Give Up until She Was Born via Surrogate</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Three days after <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/jimmy-fallon-welcomes-daughter-frances-cole/>Frances Cole</a> was born, her dad displayed her newborn pictures upon his return on his show. As Jimmy gushed about Frances Cole, calling her a "cute little baby," he expressed his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/jimmyfallon/status/540290898198667264>gratitude</a> for the "angels in Texas," who contributed to the successful arrival of his daughter.</p><p class=dh>The arrival of Frances Cole was a big deal for her parents, as they had struggled with <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6bRI-pCi-M">fertility issues</a> in their efforts to have kids. They opened up about those issues during an "At Home Edition" episode of Jimmy's "The Tonight Show" in April 2020.</p><p class=dh>As they strolled their neighborhood streets, Jimmy and Nancy revealed that having children had always been a shared goal for them as a couple. As Nancy explained, it wasn't even a matter of asking each other if they were ready but of how they would have children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/d913e95d5f1072c4cc187c070385dbcd.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jimmy Fallon and his daughter, Frances, are pictured greeting the audience during the Grand Opening of Universal Orlando's Newest Attraction "Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon" at Universal Orlando on April 6, 2017, in Orlando, Florida | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>For years, however, the couple struggled and were reluctant to go for alternative birth options. Frances Cole's parents also emphasized the emotional turmoil they underwent while trying to conceive.</p><p class=dh>At one point, her mom tried different "weird teas" that would make her cry "fourteen times a day." On the other hand, her dad would sleep upside down while dangling at his feet from the ceiling. He also put magnets in his underwear.</p><p class=dh>Still, the emotional weight of failed efforts was heavy for Jimmy and Nancy; they needed to cope. Every time received bad news regarding their efforts to conceive, they would go away to destress for a weekend before returning home to try again.</p><p class=dh>Eventually, they decided to go for surrogacy and had both Frances Cole and their eldest, Winnie Rose, through that alternative. Despite their <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/parents/jimmy-fallon-wife-nancy-juvonen-talk-fertility-struggles-t180167>fertility hurdles</a>, Frances Cole's parents still encouraged their audience to persevere until their dream of parenthood was a reality.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Frances Cole Fallon Is Already Following in Her Dad's Footsteps at a Young Age</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Frances Cole made <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IH4r5_UzYQ">regular appearances</a> on her dad's "At Home Edition" in 2020 as both a guest host and – alongside Winnie Rose – she became a member of <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/tv-movies/a31927410/jimmy-fallon-kids/>the show's band</a>.

We didn’t know each other and it just kind of grew from there, so music has always been really intertwined in our love for each other, and now that we aren’t just songwriters, we’re artists.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Texas native and the “Every Other Memory” singer wed in March 2018.

I have no nice left in me.’ But&nbsp;…&nbsp;we’re all trying hard to do this, and I think the nicer you are to your partner, the easier it is.”</p><p>Scroll to see the couple’s romance in action at Sunday’s show:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BWsK55wLCYq5yjYn9xfpBmpJqqlaN6rrvRq6CsZZiqwKOtzZ1kq7GRo3qpwdGdZKmdopu8s7mMrJyxsV2ZwqbAjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-film-nerds.html><span>←</span><span>18 of the Best Nerd Characters in Film</span></a>

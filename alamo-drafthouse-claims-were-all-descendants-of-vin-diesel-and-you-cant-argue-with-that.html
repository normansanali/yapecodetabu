Shame about his hair.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Scientists at Princeton University have reconstructed this 3D model of how Adam, the first human being created by God, might have looked <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/lvnk5Pwn3P</a></p>— Alamo Drafthouse NYC (@AlamoNYC) <a href=#>October 27, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>Prior to the Alamo Drafthouse’s bombshell news, scientists widely assumed we evolved over time from single-cell organisms to the current day monstrosity of creation with thumbs we are today. The Diesel revelation throws a real spanner in the works there, but it all makes sense in a way, and finally makes his Fast and Furious character seem grounded.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>No wonder Vin Diesel is so obsessed with family, we're all his. <a href=#>https://t.co/AiU5BYUjgf</a></p>— callum (@callumskc) <a href=#>October 28, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Of course, Vin Diesel is the first human<br>We are all family <a href=#>https://t.co/01kDEbekjK</a></p>— Royal Poodle (@royal_poodle) <a href=#>October 27, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>Alternatively, Diesel could be a timeless being being for which age does not alter. A void vampire, feeding on the endless amounts of family spawned from him. There are Lovecraftian secrets hidden within Diesel’s mind, making him as close to a human library as physically possible.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Vin Diesel Confirmed as first human being.</p>— Flesh for Frankenberg (@BenHorrible) <a href=#>October 27, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>If we are all deeply related to Diesel, his status within the greater family needs to be clarified. Is he the creepy uncle? The fun-loving stepdad? Your grandfather with a dark past from the war? Or your asinine younger brother? Regardless, Diesel’s new position as the all-father of humanity should hopefully add further intrigue to human history.</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>Perhaps out of pity we’ll all be forced to go see Fast 10 like you’d see your child’s school play out of pure obligation.

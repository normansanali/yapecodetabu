Alina Habba, Donald Trump’s lawyer, boldly claims indictments had political motives and aimed to divert attention from the Bidens.
Speaking outside D.C.’s federal courthouse, Habba asserted each indictment strategically targeted the Bidens.
She contended recent charges against Trump were politically motivated, linked to the 2020 election and January 6 Capitol attack.
Moreover, Habba addressed reporters and the public as Trump arrived for his arraignment."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

While an official cause of death hasn’t been revealed, Allen explained that Andre was suffering from a “short illness,” though she didn’t specify further.</p><p>Braugher’s breakthrough role is widely considered to be 1998’s Glory. He starred opposite Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington, who won an Oscar for the movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Andre went on to play Detective Frank Pembleton on Homicide: Life on the Street for seven seasons, even earning an Emmy for the iconic role in 1998. He would go on to be nominated for 11 Emmys over his lifetime.</p><p>He later had an equally famous television role with Brooklyn 99, which he stayed with for 8 seasons. With a more light-hearted tone than his previous projects, Andre acknowledged that Brooklyn 99 was a major shift in his career, one he was grateful for.</p><p>"I just felt as though it was an opportunity to do something strikingly different from the rest of my career," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he said in 2019</a>. "I like it because it just simply opens up my mind and forces me to think in a different way. So I think I've become much more sort of supple as an actor, and more open to the incredible number of possibilities of how to play a scene."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Brooklyn-99.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Where Was The Cast Of Brooklyn 99 Before The Show?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Some of the cast members of Brooklyn 99 already had accomplished Hollywood resumes, while for others it was their star-making role.</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=andre-braugher-rsquo-s-ldquo-brooklyn-99-rdquo-co-stars-mourn-his-death-online>Andre Braugher’s “Brooklyn 99” Co-Stars Mourn His Death Online</h2><p>With a decade-long career, there’s no denying Andre made his mark in Hollywood.

"Can’t believe you’re gone so soon," Crew captioned a tribute post to Andre.</p><p>"I’m honored to have known you, laughed with you, worked with you and shared 8 glorious years watching your irreplaceable talent. This hurts," he continued alongside a photo of Andre. "You left us too soon. You taught me so much. I will be forever grateful for the experience of knowing you. Thank you for your wisdom, your advice, your kindness and your friendship. Deepest condolences to your wife and family in this difficult time.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Crews added, “You showed me what a life well lived looks like." He concluded his note with the show's favorite chant, "#nineine," and a note, "Rest In Peace, Andre. I love you, man."</p><p>Andre’s other Brooklyn 99 co-star Dirk Blocker <a href=#>released a similar message on social media</a>, writing, "Fiercely intelligent, remarkably kind, supportive, generous and possessed a deep and extraordinary talent, and had even more to offer. I am devastated. I love him. The 9 years I was able to work with him and to just be in his presence was truly a blessing. My heartfelt condolences go out to his family."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Similarly, Joel McKinnon Miller, wrote in a post, "An actor prepares… Sending love to Andre’s family and friends and all of us who had the honor of working with him.”</p><p>Needless to say, Andre Braugher will be sorely missed by fans and friends alike.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp5yimnqjvsCunqGdoqh6pLuMrKuaqqNiurDB0adknZ2RqbVuudisq56qmaTCtHnIpaOnnaOofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christina-perri.html><span>←</span><span> Christina Perri Arms lyrics</span></a>

The hosts didn’t take long to ask which charter they preferred.</p><p>“Oh, hands down sailing,” spilled Bryan.</p><p>The hosts questioned whether their preference for Below Deck Sailing Yacht had anything to do with Captain Lee. It was pretty clear the hosts aren’t Captain Lee fans.</p><p>“Well, we love Captain Glenn. We just love Glenn,” Rob stated, adding, “We just love Glenn.”</p><p>After the hosts referred to Captain Lee as old and angry, Bryan shared his thoughts on the OG captain.</p><p>“You could say curmudgeonly could be the word for it. Salty captain that fits him to a T,” Bryan expressed.</p><p>Although they were set in their love for Captain Glenn over Captain Lee, there was another question Rob and Bryan struggled to answer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-which-chef-earned-their-praise-below-deck-sailing-yacht-s-chef-ileisha-dell-or-rachel-hargrove>Which chef earned their praise, Below Deck Sailing Yacht’s chef Ileisha Dell or Rachel Hargrove?</h2><p>Later, Bryan and Rob were, of course, asked about the food considering Bryan’s vast preference sheet. The two guys did not want to answer if they liked <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">chef Ileisha Dell</a> or chef Rachel.</p><p>“I mean, I absolutely adore Chef Ileisha. I adore her food, and I adore her as a person. I loved Rachel. I can’t say anything bad about her food. She’s an excellent chef,” Bryan said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>The guys discussed how sweet both chefs were and how they didn’t see the tantrums in the galley, so choosing was hard for them. However, when pressed for a decision, chef Ileisha came out as the winner.</p><p>“I love Ileisha. There, happy?” Bryan said.</p><p>Regarding the crew love drama, Rob and Bryan didn’t hear about any of that either.</p><p>As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Monsters and Critics previously reported,</a> Daisy Kelliher has been taking the trolls over her love triangle with Gary King and Colin MacRae.</p><p>The reunion for Below Deck Sailing Yacht Season 4 is almost here, with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">crew looks being unveiled the other day</a>. That means, finally, fans will get some questions answered, like what really went down with Colin and Daisy.</p><p>What do you think of Bryan’s Captain Lee comment?</p><p>Below Deck Sailing Yacht airs Mondays at 8/7c on Bravo. Seasons 1-4 are streaming on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5KaubDDjJ2cnKNdmLWivtOeqWafpZrAtXnDoqqsnaNisKK805qgp2WcmrJuvs6smZqbmGKup8DEq2SbnZykxG6wxJyiZquRnrmqusZmsJqbmKl6tMDIp6to</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-you-should-be-careful-buying-sports-memorabilia-on-ebay.html><span>←</span><span>Why you should be careful buying sports memorabilia on eBay</span></a>

Again, I’m telling you right now Joe … I told you and your wife, ‘I did not do that,’” Bo shared in an audio clip shared by <a href=#>@allabouttrh</a> on Twitter.</p><p>“As far as me doing any other personal investigations for Lou other than the cast members, that’s none of your business, you little punk,” Bo went on.</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><p>“I tell you what, if you call me a liar and you want to have a problem with me, I don’t think you want me after you.</p><p>“Because [I’ll] tell you right now Joe, I’ll do the investigation on you for free by me. I don’t need Lou to pay for it. You better know who you’re talking to. I’m not one of those little punks that you’re running around. You might go in the gym there, watch your little muscles, but muscles doesn’t give somebody balls,” he added.</p><p>“You wanna play with me?” Bo said. “Why don’t you ask some of your friends about me?

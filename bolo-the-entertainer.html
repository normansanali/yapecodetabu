He also appears to have an older sister. He lost his beloved mother in October of 2020. He had paid her an emotional tribute on Instagram at the time, referring to her as the brains behind his brand ‘BOLO The Entertainer.’</p><p>He also wrote, implying a less-than-ideal upbringing, “SHE FILLED THE VOIDS OF PARENTING, THAT I FELT I MISSED OUT ON IN MY UPBRINGING.”</p><p>Previously, in August 2019, he shared on Instagram with his fans that the “Johnsons” took him in years ago and treated him as if he were one of their own. Thanking “MOMMA, POPS, JUBY, AND SONNY,” he wrote, “THEY FED ME, SHELTERED ME, SUPPORTED ME, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THEY PRAYED FOR ME AT THE HARDEST TIMES OF MY LIFE!!!!” I COULD NEVER REWARD THEM FOR THE AMOUNT OF LOVE THEY HAVE BESTOWED ON ME… SO MY PROMISE IS TO ALWAYS GIVE THEM LOYALTY, AUTHENTICITY, AND HONOR…”</p><h2><span id=BOLO_The_Entertainer8217s_Height_Weight>BOLO The Entertainer’s Height, Weight</span></h2><p><strong>BOLO is an abbreviation for “B The Entertainer stands 5′ 11′′ tall and weighs less than 100 kg,</strong> owing to his chiseled and exceptionally athletic physique.</p><p>BOLO is tall, dark, and handsome, with a tattoo map carved on his chest and arms.

He was also on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, albeit with less notoriety.

The following year, he joined the cast of Kinky. He landed a notable role in Lolita Snipe’s hit stageplay, Head Over Heels, at some point.</p><p>Michael has been performing all over the country and abroad for over a decade, and he is now one of the most sought-after dancers in the world. And, at this rate, he’ll be a household name, especially after his RHOA stint.</p><p>Concerning his appearance on RHOA, one of the show’s housewives, Porsha Williams, was seen inviting BOLO back to the house to hang out and “just party.” BOLO, on the other hand, appears to have agreed to go to the bachelorette pad as long as the cameras stopped filming for the show. Having said that, the rest of the plots were scheduled for the upcoming episode.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_worth_of_BOLO_The_Entertainer><span class="TextRun SCXW112332808 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=none><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW112332808 BCX8">What is the Net worth of BOLO The Entertainer?</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW112332808 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>In any case, BOLO The Entertainer, who created a clothing line (Bo’Wear), a bath and body line (Bo’s Bath and Body Signature collection), and other personalized merchandise, was estimated to have a net worth of nearly $1 million by February 2021.</p><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>BOLO The Entertainer estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.

Kandi Burruss allegedly hired a male stripper on a famous girl’s trip, and things allegedly got X-rated (of course BOLO). According to reports, two housewives, Porsha Williams and Tanya Sam got drunk and joined BOLO in a threesome.</p><p>Porsha and Tanya, on the other hand, have consistently denied the rumors. BOLO has also denied any involvement. He was hired by Bravo Entertainment for the night of the “stripper game.” Aside from that, he denied being a part of anything else. In October 2020, he took to Instagram to clarify the raging rumors. “To whom it may concern,” he said. I’m more than just a stripper. I’m the female stripper. Professionalism is the foundation of my entire brand. It doesn’t end there. That can be attested to by my fans, followers, and supporters. The current rumors and allegations are complete nonsense. Even though I was flattered to be included in the same conversation as those lovely ladies, nothing happened. Nothing happened once more.”</p><p>Having said that, fans’ questions about his relationship status, such as whether he has a wife, girlfriend, or children, went unanswered.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>entertainer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>All About Olivia Presti | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></h3>Olivia Presti is a young Canadian entertainer.

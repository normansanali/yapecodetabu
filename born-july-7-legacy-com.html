<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Born July 7 - Legacy.com</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>At 42, Satchel Paige was the oldest rookie in Major League Baseball history, making his debut in 1948 after spending decades as a star in the Negro Leagues.&nbsp;Paige was one of the first black players in the MLB, following the official end of the “color barrier” in baseball. Before joining the Cleveland Indians, Paige played for teams in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and all around the United States, honing his skills as an intimidatingly powerful pitcher. As an MLB player, Paige was renowned for his technical prowess and athleticism, as well as his infectious spirit and obvious love of the game. In 1971, he became the first Negro Leagues player ever inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. We remember Paige’s life today as well as the lives of other notable people who died this day in history.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Click to discover notable people who died this day in history including Hollywood femme fatale Veronica Lake.</a></strong></p><p><strong>1943: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Joel Siegel</strong></a>, U.S. journalist who was the longtime film critic for “Good Morning America,” is born in Los Angeles, California.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async id=ctl00_MainContent_ObitSynopsisPhoto title src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ak-cache.legacy.com/legacy/images/Portraits/Joel-Siegel-dead-89914099port.jpgx?w=117&h=151&option=1&v=0x0000000019893535" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a>He landed in New York City in 1972 and worked as a reporter for WCBS-TV. He also hosted “Joel Siegel’s New York” on WCBS Radio. Four years later, he jumped to WABC-TV, cementing his reputation as a film critic over the next three decades. In 1981, he joined “Good Morning America” and became a regular as the network’s entertainment editor, easily recognizable by his thick mustache and glasses. In addition to Emmy awards, he also received a public service award from the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith, and the New York State Associated Press Broadcasters Association Award for general excellence in individual reporting. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a></p><p><strong>1941: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jim Rodford</a></strong>, bass player for Argent, the Kinks, and the Zombies, is born in St. Albans, England.</p><p><strong>1932: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Joe Zawinul</strong></a>, Austrian jazz keyboardist who played with Miles Davis and Cannonball Adderly and co-founded the jazz fusion band Weather Report, is born in Vienna, Austria.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async id=ctl00_MainContent_ObitSynopsisPhoto title src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ak-cache.legacy.com/legacy/images/Portraits/Joe-Zawinul-dead-94260831port.jpgx?w=117&h=151&option=1&v=0x000000002ac3b208" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a>Zawinul won widespread acclaim for his keyboard work on chart-topping Davis albums such as “In a Silent Way” and “Bitches Brew,” and was a leading force behind the so-called Electric Jazz&nbsp;movement. In 1970, Zawinul founded the band Weather Report and produced a series of albums including “Heavy Weather,” “Black Market,” and “I Sing the Body Electric.” After that band’s breakup, he founded the Zawinul Syndicate in 1987. Zawinul, who was born in the Austrian capital, Vienna, and immigrated to the United States in 1959, is credited with bringing the electric piano and synthesizer into the jazz mainstream. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a></p><p><strong>1931: David Eddings</strong>, U.S. author who wrote epic fantasy novel series including “The Belgariad,” is born in Spokane, Washington.</p><p><strong>1927: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Charlie Louvin</strong></a>, U.S. singer-songwriter who formed the Louvin Brothers with his brother, Ira, and was a member of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grand Ole Opry</a>, is born in Henagar, Alabama.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ak-cache.legacy.net/usercontent/ns/photos/louvin.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a>Their tempestuous relationship as brothers and as bandmates – and Ira’s occasional bad behavior – brought their partnership to an end in 1963, when Charlie started a solo career. But the songs they created together tell a story of collaboration. Their tight harmonies are distinctive, and their instruments weave perfect accompaniments. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a></p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.youtube.com/watch?v=krBab9GGyr0" alt width=430 height=305 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>1924: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Mary Ford</strong></a>, U.S. singer and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">guitarist</a> known best for her recordings with her husband, guitarist <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Les Paul</a></strong>, is born in El Monte, California.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ak-cache.legacy.net/UserContent/ns/Photos/Mary_Ford_117x151.jpg alt="Mary Ford" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a>The professional relationship&nbsp;soon blossomed into romance, and Paul and Ford were married in 1949. Not long after,&nbsp;they appeared together on “The Les Paul Show” radio broadcast. At this time, Paul and Ford were experimenting with multitrack recording, which allowed Ford to harmonize with her own voice, a completely new idea at the time. Placing the microphone much closer to the singer’s mouth (the studio standard in the 1940s had been 6 inches at a minimum) allowed for warmer, more relaxed, less brassy vocals. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a></p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkGf1GHAxhE" alt width=430 height=305 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>1919: Jon Pertwee</strong>, English actor who played the third doctor on “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Doctor Who</a>,” is born in London, England.</p><p><strong>1915: Margaret Walker</strong>, U.S. author and poet known best for her poetry collection “For My People,” is born in Birmingham, Alabama.</p><p><strong>1913: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pinetop Perkins</strong></a>, U.S. blues pianist who was the oldest-ever winner of a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grammy Award</a>, winning at 97 for his album with Willie “Big Eyes” Smith, “Joined at the Hip,” is born in Belzoni, Mississippi.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async id=ctl00_MainContent_ObitSynopsisPhoto title="Pinetop Perkins (AP Photo)" src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ak-cache.legacy.com/legacy/images/Portraits/Pinetop-Perkins-dead-149542579port.jpgx?w=117&h=151&option=1&v=0x000000002532eb03" alt="Pinetop Perkins (AP Photo)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a>In an 80-year career, he played at juke joints, nightclubs, and festivals. He didn’t start recording in his own name until he was in his 70s and released more than 15 solo records since 1992.&nbsp;That drive to keep playing the blues is what kept him alive, said his agent, Hugh Southard.&nbsp;Smith said Perkins once told him he was happiest when he was playing music.&nbsp;Perkins also loved fast food and was a smoker until the day he died.&nbsp;“Two cheeseburgers, apple pie, a cigarette, and a pretty girl was all he wanted,” Southard said. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a></p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXp07iI774o" alt width=430 height=305 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>1907: Robert A.

Brad played basketball professionally from 1986 to 1995, and currently he works as a college basketball and NASCAR analyst on ESPN.</p><p>How much is the net worth of Brad Daugherty? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the outright size of his wealth is as much as $20 million, as of the data presented in the middle of 2016.</p><h3>Brad Daugherty Net Worth $20 Million</h3><p>To begin with, Brad Daugherty entered the University of North Carolina in the summer of 1982. At first, Daugherty played in the shadow of future basketball heroes named <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a>, <a href=#>James Worthy</a> and <a href=#>Sam Perkins</a>. When all of them went on to continue their careers playing in the NBA, Daugherty carried the team on his broad shoulders. He completed his college career with a final top level season running at 20.2 points and nine rebounds per game. Then, all observers predicted an outstanding career in the NBA for him.</p><p>Concerning his professional career, Brad Daugherty was selected the 1st in the 1st round of the NBA Draft 1986 by the Cleveland Cavaliers. With the help of <a href=#>Ron Harper</a> and Mark Price, Daugherty had a solid first season with an average of 15.7 points 8.1 rebounds and 3.8 assists per game, and was selected to the All-Rookie Team. The following season, Daugherty became the top scorer and rebounder of the team, and participated in the NBA All-Star Game 1988 alongside other league stars <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a>, <a href=#>Magic Johnson</a> , <a href=#>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a> and <a href=#>Larry Bird</a>. In 1988-1989, Daugherty led the Cavaliers to their best record in the franchise’s history with 57 wins and 25 losses. Unfortunately, an injury forced Daugherty to miss 41 games of the 1989 – 1990 season but he returned in time to help the Cavaliers to reach the playoffs for the 3rd consecutive year. The following season was the best one for Brad Daugherty. He became the first player in the franchise (and still only) to compile at least 20 points and 10 rebounds per game average for a season. In 1991–1992 season, Daugherty confirmed that he was one of the dominant centre in the league by averaging 21.5 points and 10.2 rebounds per game. As a reward for his performance, Daugherty was elected into the All-NBA Third Team, but after another season in the playoffs, Daugherty announced his retirement from the professional sport, being only 28 years old because of a herniated disc. Despite his truncated career, Brad Daugherty established four records for the Cleveland franchise – the leading scorer with 10,389 points, best rebounder with 5,227 outlets, and the most free throws attempted and accomplished (3670 to 2741 successful).</p><p>After his retirement, Daugherty invested in waste management, real estate as well as car dealerships. He is also an analyst of college basketball and NASCAR on ESPN, plus Brad co-owns JTG Daugherty Racing. It is worth mentioning the fact that he was the co-owner of NASCAR Camping World Truck Series team.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of the former basketball player, he has been married to Heidi Rost since 1990, and they have a son.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=20.650421743205><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Brad Daugherty</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 Million</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 19, 1965, in Black Mountain, North Carolina USA</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Black Mountain, North Carolina USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>2.13&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>111&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Profession</td><td>Businessman, American NASCAR analyst, NASCAR broadcaster for ESPN, Former professional Basketball Player, NBA basketball player</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Charles D.

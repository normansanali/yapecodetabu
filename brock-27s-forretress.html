Having earlier expressed that Pineco's violently unstable temper and tendency to explode was both cool and a true challenge for a <a href=# title="Pokémon Breeder (Trainer class)">Pokémon Breeder</a>, Brock attempted to catch one. However, he tripped on a rock and headbutted the tree, frightening the Pineco so much that they all exploded. Brock got his chance later when <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket</a> attempted to steal all of the Apricorns. The giant fan blew all of the Pineco out instead, and Brock managed to catch one in his arms before it hit the ground. However, the Pineco pried itself free and attacked Team Rocket, tackling the trio off their machine. It engaged in a battle against <a href=# title="Jessie's Arbok">Jessie's Arbok</a> alone, but could not match the powerful snake and began to flee. <a href=# title=Maizie>Maizie</a> told Brock that he could capture the Pineco in the <a href=# title="Fast Ball">Fast Ball</a>, which he did just as Arbok tackled, causing Arbok to crash into its Trainer. Once Pikachu drove Team Rocket away, Brock sent out Pineco and promised they would be good friends. Pineco enthusiastically used Self-Destruct on its new friend.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=EP176>Ariados, Amigos</a></i>, Brock volunteered Pineco and himself as a duo to train under <a href=# title="Aya (anime)">Aya</a> at the <a href=# title="Pokémon Jujitsu Academy">Pokémon Jujitsu Academy</a>. However, Pineco was so startled by Brock's enthusiasm that it exploded in Brock's arms. Brock and Pineco later stunned everyone in the Technical class with Pineco's superb Spikes attack. Both were happy to hear they were in such perfect sync, and Pineco promptly exploded again.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title="Mewtwo Returns">Mewtwo Returns</a></i>, Pineco was sent out alongside Brock and Misty's Pokémon to stop <a href=# title="Giovanni (anime)">Giovanni</a> and the rest of <a href=# title="Team Rocket">Team Rocket</a> from recapturing <a href=# title="Mewtwo (M01)">Mewtwo</a>. Their distraction gave Ash the time he needed to take Mewtwo to the top of <a href=# title="Mount Quena">Mount Quena</a> so it could be healed. In <i><a href=# title=EP184>All That Glitters!</a></i>, <a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a>'s <a href=# title=Badge>Fog Badge</a> was stolen by a trio of <a href=# title="Murkrow (Pokémon)">Murkrow</a>. Ash, <a href=# title="Misty (anime)">Misty</a>, <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a>, and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Misty's Togepi">Togepi</a> distracted the Darkness Pokémon while Brock lowered Pineco down to get it back. Although Pineco retrieved it, the Murkrow figured out their plan while it was being lifted back up to safety. They attacked it and stole the badge back, after which Pineco exploded.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=EP193>Sick Daze</a></i>, Pineco and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Brock's Golbat">Golbat</a> watched over Brock when he fell ill.

Brock jumped after it, catching his Pokémon until a wild <a href=# title="Ursaring (Pokémon)">Ursaring</a> crashed into him and knocked them apart. Upset by this, Pineco evolved into Forretress to save Brock. Its evolution induced a large explosion, which nullified Team Rocket's suction and allowed Brock and the Pokémon to escape. In the <a href=# title=EP260>next episode</a>, it prevented Team Rocket from stealing a <a href=# title="King's Rock">King's Rock</a> by using its newly-learned Rapid Spin to trip them up and delay them long enough for <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a> to get rid of them with <a href=# title="Thunderbolt (move)">Thunderbolt</a>.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=EP273>Gotta Catch Ya Later!</a></i>, Forretress defeated the <a href=# title="Hitmonlee (Pokémon)">Hitmonlee</a> belonging to Kail of the <a href=# title="Invincible Pokémon Brothers">Invincible Pokémon Brothers</a> with Rapid Spin.</p><h4><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_the_Series:_Ruby_and_Sapphire></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_the_Series:_Ruby_and_Sapphire><i><a href=# title="Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire">Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire</a></i></span></h4><h5><span class=mw-headline id=Hoenn>Hoenn</span></h5><p>In <i><a href=# title=AG004>You Never Can Taillow</a></i>, Forretress came to the rescue of Ash and his new friends, <a href=# title="May (anime)">May</a> and <a href=# title=Max>Max</a>, sent out by Brock to use its newly-learned Explosion to drive away a mass of attacking <a href=# title="Taillow (Pokémon)">Taillow</a>.

While fans were excitedly waiting for Williams to come back on the air, the only news they got was that of him departing.</p><h2>Cameron Williams Is Leaving Channel Nine</h2><p>As to a source from The Daily Telegraph (via Dailymail), Williams announced his leave through an email to workers on Wednesday, March 23, 2022. In the email, he claimed his “increasingly terrible health” as the reason for departing.</p><p>“It’s with a deep heart I have chosen to retire from Nine,” the email stated. “Leaving the finest team in News is painful and being part of that team, an honor,”</p><p>The sports broadcaster underlined how he had fought with his health for years until that time, and it was not getting any better.</p><p>“I want to handle that now for the sake of a more important team, my family,” he wrote meticulously.</p><p>After Williams said he was going on, Channel Nine’s Director of News Darren Wick followed up with an email of his own. In his statement, Wick repeated Williams’ resignation and told the channel crew about why he was departing.</p><p>“Cam is leaving us to focus on his health and then to seek other options that we look forward to hearing more about,” Wick added.</p><p>He congratulated Williams for his commitment to Channel Nine throughout his years of work.</p><h2>Cameron Williams In Journalism</h2><p>As per the sports presenter’s bio on Channel Nine’s website, he was with the network for well over a decade.<br>Born in Emerald, Queensland, the Australian native’s media career began in 1984 with a cadetship at the Courier-Mail newspaper in Brisbane. Shortly after that period, he switched over to The Australian Newspaper, where he was given sports stories and articles.</p><p>Following that, he moved on to join the Seven Network in 1998. His major function while on Seven Network was as a presenter. However, he was also the host of the 11 am timeslot show Sportsworld. The highlight of his stint on the network was probably his 1992 Barcelona Olympics coverage, as he called Matt Ryan’s equestrian double gold for Australia.</p><p>He joined Fox Sports in 1996, and in his five years there, he anchored NRL on FOX, Dally M Awards, Super 12 Rugby, Wimbledon, Winter Olympics, the Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix, and Fox Sports news.</p><p>After a spell as the breakfast announcer at 2HD Newcastle, Williams joined Channel Nine’s Today Show in January 2006. The highlights of Williams’ work at Channel Nine include his coverage of Nine’s horse racing coverage, guest reports on 60 minutes, the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010, and Nine’s coverage of the 2012 London Olympics.</p><p>Not to add, he was the one who reported one of Australia’s worst national catastrophes, the 2010 Queensland flood crisis, with Today Show’s Karl Stefanovic.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Cameron Williams</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Channel Nine</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiamqWVp7yvedaio6WhkaLAbrXSZqOemaaeu6h5wqGYp6aVoXqvtc2eZJ%2BnomKubsLAq6CerKlivKd50Z6YrKeeqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./asher-levine-net-worth-268650.html><span>←</span><span>Asher Levine Net Worth</span></a>

I never thought that you
Would be the one to hold my heart
But you came around
And you knocked me off the ground from the startYou put your arms around me

You put your arms around me and I'm home
How many times will you let me
Change my mind and turn around?
I can't decide if I'll let you save my life</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Andre Braughers Co-Stars Mourn Him After Shocking Death From Mysterious Illness</h2><time>Sep 10, 2024</time>

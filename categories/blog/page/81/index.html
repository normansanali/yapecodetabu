The X300s was the Self-Encrypting Drive variant of the X300, but for the X400 SanDisk is unifying the two by making encryption a standard feature, pending a firmware update due in April to provide full TCG Opal support.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Sauteed Broccolini</h2><time>Aug 21, 2024</time>

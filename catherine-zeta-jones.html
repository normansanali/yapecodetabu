I’m the sort of person who will just look for the negative – Michael really can’t understand it, but that’s just the way I am. And with my bipolar thing, that’s poison. So I just stopped. Cold turkey. And it’s so liberating.”&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;Catherine Zeta-Jones</strong></li><li>”&nbsp;I find this wave of super-skinny women scary. I’m not going to lie to you, I’ve got to drag myself down to the gym like everybody else. But I look at the red carpet sometimes and it’s like a pageant.”&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;Catherine Zeta-Jones</strong></li><li>”&nbsp;I used to go around looking as frumpy as possible because it was inconceivable you could be attractive as well as be smart. It wasn’t until I started being myself, the way I like to turn out to meet people that I started to get any work.”&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;Catherine Zeta-Jones</strong></li><li>“I’m not the kind of person who likes to shout out my personal issues from the rooftops, but with my bipolar becoming public, I hope fellow sufferers will know it’s completely controllable. I hope I can help remove any stigma attached to it, and that those who don’t have it under control will seek help with all that is available to treat it.&nbsp;”&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;Catherine Zeta-Jones</strong></li><li>“I like women who look like women. I hated grunge. No one’s more feminist than me, but you don’t have to look as if you don’t give a – you know. You can be smart, bright, and attractive aesthetically to others – and to yourself.”&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;Catherine Zeta-Jones</strong></li></ul><h2>3 Astonishing Examples From Catherine Zeta-Jones</h2><p>Since it has become so undeniably obvious about Catherine Zeta-Jones’ total assets here are some focus points from her great life and profession.</p><p>Here are the absolute best achievement illustrations to gain from Catherine Zeta-Jones:</p><h3>1.

And there are too many tasks to count. Chimes in DIY expert Chris, 40, “Getting organized for this little creature was so much work. I knew other couples were going through the same thing.”</p><p>Enter: his digital home-improvement show, <i>Controlled Chaos</i>. “It’s all about setting up your house to be kid-friendly, but at the same time not having it look like a nursery,” explains Chris. “We find a happy medium for everyone.”</p><p>The Bachelor Nation duo, who now have daughter Lyla, 7 months, share more with <i>Us</i>.</p><p><b>Us Weekly: What are your best tips for new moms and dads?</b></p><p><b>Peyton Lambton</b>: You don’t need to buy a million gadgets. Honestly, you need a blanket you can lay them down on and you’ll be good. That helps keep space from becoming completely occupied. Also, find furniture that doubles as storage. We have a lot of pieces that I can tuck baskets away in.</p><p><b>Chris Lambton</b>: You should see how organized Peyton is! Every basket is labeled. There’s one for diapers, wipes. It’s all easy to find, which is perfect when I’m looking for something.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/chris-and-peyton-lambton-6dd73f8a-e0b6-4795-85a7-5c5ecc5710f2.jpg><p><b>Us: Did you go overboard with baby-proofing your house?</b></p><p><b>PL</b>: When it comes to a child, you can never be too careful. It’s a personal preference. We got down on all fours and saw what she sees and what danger lies ahead when you’re down at her level.</p><span class=caption></span><p><b>Us: How did you go about decorating the nursery?</b></p><p><b>PL</b>: Since we didn’t know the sex of the baby, we painted it a mint green, which is gender-neutral.</p><p><b>CL</b>: My favorite part is the bookshelf I built that makes the books look like pieces of wall art. Our favorite book to read her at bedtime right now is <i>The Pout-Pout Fish</i>.</p><p><b>Us: Which traits of yours does Lyla have?</b></p><p><b>CL</b>: She’s super happy and she sleeps well, like her mom. But she’s a morning person like I am. In the morning, the two of us get up and have father-daughter time. She’s so much fun!</p><p><b>Us: Will she make an appearance on your?</b></p><p><b>PL</b>: I did some baby proofing videos and a couple different things for Wayfair’s YouTube channel and she shot with me. You’ll see her there!</p><p><b>CL</b>: I’m going to brag! I had her while Peyton was shooting and she was like, ‘Bring in Lyla,’ so I did. When the cameras turned on, her face lit up! She was smiling and giggling. I was like, ‘Wow! I’m like a TV dad.’</p><p><b>Us: OK, be honest: Would you let Lyla be on <i>The Bachelor</i>?</b></p><p><b>PL</b>: I feel like we couldn’t say no. That would be so hypocritical.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><b>CL</b>: It led me to finding Peyton and having Lyla, so I’d say go for it!</p><p><i>New episodes of </i>Controlled Chaos<i> stream Mondays on <a href=#>builddesignlive.com</a>.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqhqpmoerGx2K2mp2WclrqjwM6nZKyZqWK9or7Ep6uippdiwba%2BzaxkpaGWmnq2vNKim55llKTEr3nWbW9yaGNlfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bill-wards-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Bill Wards net worth, biography, fact, career, awards and life story</span></a>

Post-Katrina, Rose picked up reputation and awards as he chronicled the individual and open battles of the catastrophe-stricken zone.</p><p>Rose’s segment routinely shows up at his “New Orleans stories” Times-Picayune site. He came back to the subject in different ways, as in caricaturizing the 2008-2009 email discussions swelling around New Orleans city hall leader Ray Nagin and Councilwoman Stacy Head.</p><p>He left the paper in late 2009 and joined the New Orleans alternative weekly paper, Gambit Weekly, in mid-February 2010. He moved to WVUE Fox News 8 a year later, where he delivered his pungent commentary on New Orleans life by video and column, up until his abrupt and arguably controversial termination in March 2013.</p><p>After his dismissals from Gambit and WVUE, Rose found work as a restaurant waiter. More recently, Chris Rose has been writing for Rouses, a grocery store chain based in Louisiana. Rose writes for the chain’s trade magazine, contributing articles on food-related topics.</p><p>In 2016, Rose became a licensed tour guide. His walking tour covers mainly the music history of New Orleans and Louisiana.</p><p>Rose is also the author of&nbsp;<i>1 Dead in Attic</i>, which is a collection of stories recounting the first four harrowing months of life in New Orleans after Katrina. The book went on to become a New York Times Bestseller and garnered a number of accolades.</p><p>Rose reigned as King of the&nbsp;Krewe du Vieux&nbsp;for the 2007&nbsp;New Orleans Mardi Gras season.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-rose-awards-and-nominations></span><span>Chris Rose Awards and nominations</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rose was a finalist for the&nbsp;Pulitzer Prize for Distinguished Commentary&nbsp;in 2006 and won a Pulitzer for his contributions to the&nbsp;<i>Times-Picayune’</i>s&nbsp;Public Service Award.

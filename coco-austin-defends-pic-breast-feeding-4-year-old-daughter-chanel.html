Thank you to all that understand my view. I see most of you are so eager to side with me and I too root for you in your journey as well. Us moms are connected.”</p><p>In September 2019, the actress told Us Weekly exclusively that Instagram trolls “need to have a baby to understand” <a href=#>why she bonds with Chanel through breast-feeding</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[They] just have some time to kill [and] need to say something to get a reaction from you, and I don’t want to give them any time,” she explained to Us at the time. “I want to give lovers time, not the haters. … [Nursing is] about giving love to your child and bonding with your child and also giving them good nutrition. Breast milk is like liquid gold. All around, it’s a good thing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Coco-Austin-Defends-Pic-Breast-Feeding-4-Year-Old-Daughter.jpg><p>Her husband, 62, chimed in, “What I think confuses people is they [see pictures] and they think Chanel doesn’t eat food. And she eats cheeseburgers. She only breast-feeds … like, when she cries [and] she just wants to get close to her mama. She throws the boob out and … holds on. She’s not doing it for nourishment. This chick eats chili fries, OK?”</p><p>Austin and the rapper <a href=#>welcomed their daughter in 2015</a>, 10 years after tying the knot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacp5OkeqLB0q2gp2WUmrOmusOsZKmhk2Kvs7HArKtmnpWasaq6xmZrZrGVlr9uu8udZJ2ZpZy1tbHRZpqhmZ6auXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fast-and-furious-feuds-timeline-vin-diesel-the-rock-tyrese-3065577.html><span>←</span><span>A Timeline Of The Beef Behind The Scenes Hollywood Life</span></a>

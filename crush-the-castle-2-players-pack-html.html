Surely you must be curious about how it works, so that you do a great job at it, so allow us to explain in the next part of the description what this is all about! You are going to use a catapult to throw rocks at the castles, with your goal being to crush them all to the ground, for which you are going to get points in return. You are going to use the mouse in order to maneuver the catapult, with which you should give it your best to aim as good as possible, and hit the castle in each level, in the first try if possible, since that will bring you even more points. Start the fun right now, and remember that we still have plenty other games to offer you here today!</p><h4>How to play?</h4><p>Use the mouse.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qK3MnqqzmaBjsLC5jqCYpp1fbIB1f46cqa6rmGLBqbGMnJisrJyaenN5z6WYsp2iqHqxrcKkZaGsnaE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brennan-parachek-essential-hat.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Brennan Parachek &amp;quot;Essential&amp;quot; hat | Fan Arch</span></a>

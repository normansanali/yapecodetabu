It is as inescapable as gravity. This and “Walking on Sunshine”: They don’t even remind you of the ‘80s anymore, they just take you back to the last Totally Awesome Flashback Friday you heard on your local Jack FM–style radio station. So how is it that I had never seen the video until just now? Click and watch Marc Almond wear a micro-toga and have a level-ten snit at a child.

Hideous people with unkempt beards and tattoos their friend Wayne did for cheap, bobbing arrhythmically in a filthy diner with eggshell walls, while women dance drowsily in swimsuit bottoms and those white plastic chains your local bank uses to organize the lines for the teller windows.

I missed it, and Diana Ross’s from the following year. I did see Garth Brooks there in 1996, and after every song, when the crowd would applaud, Garth would break his end-of-song fist-in-the-air rock-star pose and look out into the audience in disbelief. Like: You’re&nbsp;</span><i>clapping</i>?<span>&nbsp;For&nbsp;</span><i>me</i>?<span>&nbsp;Are you sure? As though it were the first time it had ever happened. After every song.

The Roxy is still right there on the Sunset Strip, by the way, just next door to the Rainbow, an Italian restaurant where it is still very much 1988.

It was fascinating, it was terrifying, it was hilarious, it was completely scrubbed from her feed because it probably made a lot of people very nervous.

I don’t know what I love more: the iridescent outfits or the notion that these two city gals would use the word “taters.” But the thing I love most of all is that Bobbie Horowitz (the one on the right, with the mouth) kept on trucking; after Horowitz & Spector parted ways, she went solo and became a fixture on the New York cabaret scene, all while maintaining an image-consulting business called “Healthy, Wealthy and WOW!” I’m not making any of that up. Here she is at the Cornelia Street Cafe singing a song called “It Shows to Go Ya,” which contains the unforgettable and irrefutable lyric “</span><a href=#>It’s bullshit to be anyone but you</a><span>.” I want a Bobbie Horowitz biopic and I want it now.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-60a436171a43e9ba4f1309fd0b8831d4-31-0-0@published data-word-count=15><b>13. <a href=#>“Heat of the Moment,” Asia<br></a></b><span>We were pretty literal with our videos back in 1982.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-60a436171a43e9ba4f1309fd0b8831d4-32-0-0@published data-word-count=44><b>12. <a href=#>“Beatles Movie Medley,” Beatles<br></a></b><span>We were doing a lot of this in the very early ‘80s. “</span><a href=#>Stars on 45</a><span>,” “</span><a href=#>Hooked on Classics</a><span>,” the “</span><a href=#>Beach Boys Medley</a><span>“:&nbsp;</span><i>Readers Digest</i><span> condensed versions of hits from the past, repackaged for your spending pleasure.

So much of what we associate with the music and the look of the era — the synths, the pout, the pale — started right here. And either the best or worst thing about it, if you were alive during this time, was that you mostly couldn’t see it. Only a lucky few had cable, and the rest of us had to hear about it. I’d bother my classmates each morning for new details, new names, anything they could recall. It was water-cooler conversation for children. &nbsp;</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-60a436171a43e9ba4f1309fd0b8831d4-37-0-0@published data-word-count=95><b>7. <a href=#>“Chariots of Fire,” Vangelis<br></a></b><span>For Christmas 1980, in a post-</span><i>Xanadu</i><span> baby-gay roller-skate frenzy, I asked for and received a pair of red Nike sneaker-skates with big, fat red rubber wheels. By mid-1982, they were much too small for me, but I still squeezed my feet into them every Sunday morning to listen to Casey Kasem’s “American Top 40,” hoping this song would come on before we had to leave for Mass so that I could workshop the routine I’d choreographed for it.

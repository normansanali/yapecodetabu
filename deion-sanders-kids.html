"It was phenomenal, especially with my mother involved, that's just the cherry on top."</p><p>While competing may be second nature for the Sanders family, Coach Prime did reveal that he and his family loved watching his mother prepare her lines for the commercial.</p><p>"Annunciating Oikos profoundly was challenging for her because she's got this southern drawl," he laughed. But overall, Coach Prime explained that uniting with his family members, which he described as "very close," was "unbelievable."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>"I'm forever grateful and thankful that I've never been to a family reunion, let's just get that straight," he jokingly added.

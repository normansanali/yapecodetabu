So when it comes to making hip-hop, or pop, or country, I know the elements because I listen to the music and I understand what I want to do. Maybe if I do it like when I did the country song, it wasn’t nail-on-the-head country music, but it had country influences. So being all over the place, I’m actually kind of thankful for.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-the-producer-still-has-goals-for-his-music-career>The producer still has goals for his music career</h2><p id=par-8_25>While Marshmellow’s career boasts a high net worth, high-profile collaborations, and a Grammy Award nomination, the artist still has more he wants to accomplish.</p><p id=par-9_23>Speaking with Forbes, Marshmellow shared that there are more artists he wants to collaborate with and more genres he wants to try out.</p><p id=par-10_43>“The artist collaboration, there’s so many.

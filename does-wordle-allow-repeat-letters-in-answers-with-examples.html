The deceptively simple game requires players to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. Sound simple?&nbsp;Well, the game’s hints, the balance of skill and luck, and a surprisingly fiendish amount of five-letter words have made it a compulsive way to start or end the day for hundreds of thousands of players.</p><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>As the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Free Dictionary</a> puts the number of five-letter words in the English language at 158,390, Wordle has words to spare. But the brain-teaser’s deceptively simple rules don’t cover a few quirks that some players could take a while to discover. And when they do come across them, they’re not likely to forget them quickly.</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>For instance, players outside the U.S. may take a while to realize the game uses American English. While the game’s creator Josh Wardle is British, he developed the game while working as a software engineer at Reddit in California, USA.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>When The New York Times took stewardship of the game in February 2022, it re-tuned the game’s word archive to make sure no offensive or borderline offensive words could get through the mechanics. That chopped down Wordle’s vocabulary a bit, but what about words with repeated letters? Does Wordle allow five-letter words that use the same letter twice in a word, and how does it let players know?</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Does Worlde allow repeat letters?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Wordle-002-scaled.jpg><p data-characters=44 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>Yes, Wordle does allow repeat letters.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=52 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>Here are some recent examples of Wordle’s answers:</p><ul data-current-count=625.5 data-injectable=true><li>Wordle #291 — COMMA</li></ul><ul data-current-count=31.5 data-injectable=false><li>Wordle #290 — NATAL</li></ul><ul data-current-count=78.75 data-injectable=false><li>Wordle #288 — FEWER</li></ul><ul data-current-count=149.625 data-injectable=false><li>Wordle #255 — RUPEE</li></ul><ul data-current-count=255.9375 data-injectable=false><li>Wordle #262 — SWEET</li></ul><ul data-current-count=415.40625 data-injectable=true><li>Wordle #273 — ALLOW</li></ul><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=128 data-injectable=false>The game has snuck in repeat letters more than a few times since it launched, so you should count on it happening in the future.</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>It’s tricky when these letters are lined up but particularly challenging when they’re non-consecutive. That’s excellent news for the game, opening up hundreds of additional five-letter words.&nbsp; But it’s a curveball for players… unless Wordle plays nice and has a way of letting them know?</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>How does Wordle lets you know that a word has repeated letters?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Wordle-001.jpg><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>Wordle provides color tiles to tell players how close they are to getting the answer right. A green tile means a letter in the word is in the right spot. A yellow tile indicates that a player has placed a letter that’s in the word, but it’s currently in the wrong place. It’s the grey tiles that players don’t want to see too many times. They mean that a played letter doesn’t figure in the word at all.</p><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=150 data-injectable=false>But what if you’re facing a word that has the same letter repeated twice? Well, Wordle doesn’t treat it any differently from any other word.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>So if a word does feature repeated letters, you can expect a green tile if one, both are all in the right place. If they are contained within the answer but are currently positioned incorrectly, they will be highlighted yellow. If you do input two identical letters — which is a bold strategy early on in your Wordle game — and one of them is greyed out, you at least know the letter only occurs once in that day’s word.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Wordle-003-scaled.jpg><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true>That means double letters can be one of those little catches that can throw off even experienced Wordle players. After all, who wants to repeat a letter when guesses are limited?</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>Also, remember that Wordle offers a hard mode. If you haven’t activated it in settings, it may already be your default playing style without switching on the added restriction. The hard mode requires you to use any hints in subsequent guesses. If you have it activated, you may have fewer options to play around with your letters.</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Tactics for double-letter words</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Wordle-004-scaled.jpg><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=170 data-injectable=false>At least the game is all about five-letter words, which gives some good indicators of where double letters sit if you suspect that’s what you’re dealing with.</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>Just remember typical combinations, including double letters that end words like “LL” (“GRILL”), “SS” (“CRASS”), and “EE” (“THREE”).</p><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>Don’t forget the double letters in the middle of two-syllable words like “LL” (“TALLY”), “RR” (“PARRY”), and “DD” (“DADDY”).</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false>When it comes to words where the repeated letters aren’t together, well, you’ll just have to rely on that good old mix of Wordle skill and luck — and remember to have fun. There’s always a new Wordle tomorrow!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZom6ido2LEsL7DpZxmmZyhvLh50Z6nnpmkYrmmwNOeqaxlmaN6orrSsJyrq12strW0jJ6vmqWgobK0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chrisean-rock-before-and-after.html><span>←</span><span>Chrisean Rock Before And After: That Insane Blueface Face Tattoo</span></a>

Son is the family name Goku inherited from Gohan; Goku is often referred as&nbsp;Goku San,&nbsp;Son Goku San,&nbsp;Goku-Sa&nbsp;(By Chi-Chi),&nbsp;and Son Kun&nbsp;(Usually by Bulma).</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true>‘San’&nbsp;in Japanese culture is the equivalent of Mr./Ms. in English. It is often used to refer to the elderly or someone with a higher social status than yourself, such as your grandparents. Usually, wiser individuals — like mentors — would be ‘(first name) San.’</p><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>When broken down, the two syllables in Goku’s name have very different individual meanings. Together, it is commonly believed that the name ‘Goku’ in Japanese is roughly translated to “aware of emptiness.” However, the separate syllables ‘Go’ and ‘ku’ have different meanings on their own, which — when combined — roughly translate to a similar, yet slightly different overall meaning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Goku-Dragon-Ball-Against-Raditz.jpg><p data-characters=598 data-current-count=898 data-injectable=true>The kanji for Goku’s name, 悟空, can be read multiple ways. 悟, or “go,” can be read as “perceiving,” “seeing,” “understanding,” etc, while 空, or “ku,” can be read as “sky,” “void,” “empty,” etc. So things like “perceiving the void” or similar such readings, when they’re combined, is possible. Additionally, Goku is a translation of the Chinese name Sun Wukong, the protagonist of&nbsp;the novel Journey to the West by Wu Cheng’en, meaning “Monkey King”.</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false>Meanwhile, Goku’s birth name, Kakarotto, is a pun on the word ‘carrot.’ Goku’s family, like most Saiyans, are named after root vegetables, i.e. burdock, leek, radish, etc.</p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Crunchyroll will be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">releasing 15 Dragon Ball movies</a> during the months of June and July, so if there were ever a sign for a rewatch, this is it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6dqZqfn6N6o63LpWSwoJGpeqW7xKxkoKebqnquscCnZKKmXZ%2Busa3NnqqeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-derek-watts.html><span>←</span><span>Derek Watts Death: What Happened To Derek Watts?</span></a>

Barlow, who now wears much more fashionable attire, tells the camera in the new episode’s sneak peek that she’s had trouble adjusting to life away from FLDS.</p><p>“When I got out, I kind of thought it’d be real easy — I’d just get a job, go to school, get all my stuff together real quick, get a car,” Barlow says. “But it’s a lot harder than I thought. Over the course of about a month, I probably applied to about 32 different places trying to get a job, and my social skills weren’t where they needed to be. It’s so hard for me to just go up to a stranger and start talking to them because all my life I was raised, ‘Don’t ever talk to anybody out of the religion.'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Last week’s episode featured <b>Ariel</b>, 19, revealing that she is pregnant less than a year after leaving the sect.</p><p>Watch the clip above. <i>Escaping Polygamy: After the Escape</i> airs on A&E Tuesdays at 10 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJysm5Gltq%2BzjKmmpbGXlrq6edKtmKtlmWKwsMHLnaWtZZeawW6tjKOmm2WRm8Gmvoytn55lo528uHnWbW1ubWRtfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yasmeen-fletcher.html><span>←</span><span>Yasmeen Fletcher Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</span></a>

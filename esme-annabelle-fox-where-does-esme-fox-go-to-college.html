Fox and his longtime wife, Tracy Pollan, who is also a veteran in Hollywood.&nbsp;Unlike many children born to stars, Esmé and her siblings have the privilege of growing up in a functional family.</p><p>Their parents tied the knot in 1988 and have remained married ever since. Keep reading to learn more about Esmé and her life as the daughter of legends.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/esme-fotor-20231002165134-745x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Has_Michael_J_Fox_Got_Any_kids></span>Has Michael J. Fox Got Any kids?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, he does. The talented actor is a proud father of four kids he loves deeply. Their names are Sam Michael Fox, Schuyler Frances Fox, Aquinnah Kathleen Fox, and the youngest, Esmé Annabel Fox.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Esme_Annabelle_Fox_Biography></span>Esmé Annabelle Fox Biography<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She is the youngest addition to the Fox family and shares an uncanny resemblance with her father. The “Back To The Future” actor and his wife <a href=#>welcomed </a>Esmé on November 3, 2001.&nbsp;</p><p>Esmé mostly flies under the radar for now. Still, we know she has left the nest and is currently in college. Her father revealed this in 2019 during an interview.&nbsp;</p><p>With Esmé in school, Michael and his wife now have much time to themselves. At a benefit for the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, the actor talked about what they planned to do with all the time and quiet.</p><p>He said: “Our youngest is going off to college, so we are going to be empty nesters, so … we are going to do some traveling!”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Esme_Annabelle_Fox_Instagram></span>Esmé Annabelle Fox Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Even though she is active on Instagram, Esmé has her accounts set to private. Fortunately, netizens see her grow via her dad’s Instagram page, where he often posts her.</p><p>In 2020, he shared a picture of Esmé smiling for the camera while posing with her sisters and captioned it: “It’s #nationaldaughtersday, and I have three amazing daughters.”</p><p>In 2021, Michael took to Instagram again with a tribute to Esmé’s 20th birthday, revealing her cheesy nickname – Ezzie. The proud father wrote: “20 years of joy. Happy birthday, Ezzie! You are a force for good in the universe. Thanks for that. I love you, Xoxo.”</p><p>The photo captured the father-daughter duo wearing Duke University hats, where Esmé is currently schooling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ike.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_Does_Esme_Fox_Go_to_College></span>Where Does Esmé Fox Go to College?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Esmé Annabelle Fox currently attends Duke University, according to her LinkedIn. She is expected to graduate in 2025. Before enrolling at Duke, where she is aiming for a Bachelor in Arts, Esmé Annabella completed her schooling at Ethical Culture Fieldston School.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Esme_Annabelle_Fox_Dating_Someone></span>Is Esmé Annabelle Fox Dating Someone?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Details about how Esme lives her life are not always forthcoming, and information about her love life is so sparse that one might think she is uninterested in dating.&nbsp;</p><p>This has made her father’s fans curious to know more about her love life, but as far as public records show, Esmé is not dating anyone right now. And if she is, they are choosing to keep things hush-hush to avoid scrutiny.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Esme_Annabelle_Fox_Parents></span>Esmé Annabelle Fox Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her parents are Michael J. Fox and Tracy Pollan. The pair tied the knot on July 16, 1988, and have been together ever since. But what if we told you that their first encounter could have destroyed any possibility of them getting together?&nbsp;</p><p>That was precisely how it was. Michael first ran into Pollan on the set of his hit show, “Family Ties.” And while they were on set one day, he joked about the smell of her breath.</p><p>He said: “One day, we broke for lunch. After lunch, we picked up where we left off. When she said her first line, I detected a hint of garlic and sensed an opportunity to have a little fun at her expense. ‘Whoa, a little scampi for lunch, babe?'”</p><p>Pollan did not find it funny, and she reportedly called him out right then for being unkind.</p><p>Micheal <a href=#>said</a>: “At first she said nothing. Her expression didn’t even change. But looking me dead in the eyes, she said slowly, ‘That was mean and rude, and you’re a complete and total f**king a**hole.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fox.jpg><p>Her response, which he later realized was a joke, caught him off guard as he was used to better treatment. Indeed, when Pollan told him off, <a href=#>Michael J. Fox </a>fell deeply in love with her, and the rest is history.&nbsp;</p><p>Their union has lasted more than three decades, and it seems only death will be able to part with them successfully.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ksrS5xGaYp6aRl7KtuMRmnaiwXay1pr7EZpuonaNisrS5xGadqLBdnLxuwM5mmqiknJq0pns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./do-dmitri-and-stevie-get-back-together.html><span>←</span><span>Do Dmitri and Stevie get back together?

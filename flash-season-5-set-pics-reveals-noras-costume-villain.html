As it turns out, the images you’re about to take in reveal Nora Allen-West’s superhero costume, as well as a villain of some sort.</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>From the look of it, Nora’s threads aren’t that far removed from those donned by Iris when she temporarily received Barry’s powers in season 4. And this makes sense since Iris gifted that very jacket to Nora at some point in the future, which we learned of in May’s finale. The major difference, though,&nbsp;is that an insignia now adorns the chest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/flash-bts-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/flash-bts-2.jpg><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>When it comes to the villain, our best guess is that this masked man is a freak of the week, so to speak. If not, the costuming department has seriously had its budget slashed because this would be a pretty weak look for whomever will serve as the big bad for the next run.</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>Previous reports stated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cicada will&nbsp;be the next overarching antagonist</a>, but it’s important to remember nothing has been confirmed at this point. Even so, it’s expected that Barry, Nora and their pals at STAR Labs face a variety of lesser foes along the way.</p><p data-characters=71 data-current-count=71 data-injectable=false><strong>The Flash</strong> returns for its fifth season on Tuesday, October 9 on The CW.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ynuMCsn2arlZbAsLqMbmSsnaRivaqv0mapnq6Vlrm0ec2oqZqrXZi8tMDUppxmrpmhuaK1zWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sosie-bacon-all-loved-up-boyfriend-red-carpet.html><span>←</span><span>Sosie Bacon looks all loved up as she cuddles up to boyfriend on red carpet</span></a>

The fact that they let him out of their sight, that’s a no-no. Time is of the essence with these investigations.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When asked why they didn’t immediately call Laundrie out for questioning, North Port Police Department spokesman Josh Taylor told Fox News: ‘The North Port Police Department has no authority to execute a possible federal search warrant on our own.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I don’t see how anyone without all the facts in this case can come up with a reasonable conclusion and opinion on the matter.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He added: ‘There is no information that a crime took place here in North Port. That is our jurisdiction.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Missing persons experts also stressed that while there was likely not enough evidence to bring Laundrie in for questioning or to obtain a search warrant, investigators made several ‘missteps’ throughout the process.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘You always have to try to build a case and if it means surveillance to see where he’s going or what he’s doing … then you do that,’ a retired New York City police officer commented. ‘You don’t need a search warrant to surveil somebody.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Former veteran FBI agent Oliver Farache offered his opinion on the case, arguing that police should’ve asked for permission to look through Petito’s communications with her family.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I think what I would do if I was running the investigation is ask for permission to [look at Schmidt’s phone] because you don’t want to alienate the family, you want to do it in as cooperative a way as possible,’ Farache said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘You want to look at the phone, see if anything was deleted, see exactly what kind of conversation they were having and looking at the whole thing, not just the last few days. And the history of the texts that mom exchanged and dad as well will give you a clue into the missing person’s mental state as well.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, Taylor lashed out at the critics saying that the are investigating Laundrie as a missing person: ‘These guys are full of s**t. We have a missing person case and we don’t have anyone to talk to and we don’t have any evidence of a crime on a case that’s outside our jurisdiction.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘This guy goes for a hike in a 25,000-acre nature reserve. How are we following him? I’m up for anybody’s idea.’</p><img decoding=async id=i-895133d8b06eb2f4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/20/21/48162841-10010421-image-a-43_1632171203919.jpg height=336 width=634 alt="Thirteen days before her disappearance, on August 12, bodycam footage from the Moab police department in Utah showed officers questioning Petito and Laundrie - authorities were called to the scene for reports of a 'possible domestic violence' incident involving the couple near the Moonflower Community Co-opthat day around 4:30pm" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><img decoding=async id=i-895133d8b06eb2f4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/20/21/48162841-10010421-image-a-43_1632171203919.jpg height=336 width=634 alt="Thirteen days before her disappearance, on August 12, bodycam footage from the Moab police department in Utah showed officers questioning Petito and Laundrie - authorities were called to the scene for reports of a 'possible domestic violence' incident involving the couple near the Moonflower Community Co-opthat day around 4:30pm" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=imageCaption>Thirteen days before her disappearance, on August 12, bodycam footage from the Moab police department in Utah showed officers questioning Petito and Laundrie – authorities were called to the scene for reports of a ‘possible domestic violence’ incident involving the couple near the Moonflower Community Co-opthat day around 4:30pm</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Thirteen days before her disappearance, on August 12,&nbsp;bodycam footage from the Moab police department in Utah showed officers questioning Petito and Laundrie – authorities were called to the scene for reports of a ‘possible domestic violence’ incident&nbsp;involving the couple near the Moonflower Community Co-opthat day around 4:30pm.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The video shows Petito telling officers she ‘was trying to get him to stop telling me to calm down’ and admitting the couple ‘have been fighting all morning’ with tears streaming down her face.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said that she suffered from OCD and anxiety, and was stressed because of the YouTube blog she and Laundrie were working on to document the doomed cross-country trip.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Petito had slapped Laundrie, who could be seen with scratches on his face and arm in the footage.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cops determined that Petito was ‘the primary aggressor’ and separated the couple for the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Source: | This article originally belongs to <a href=#>Dailymail.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX5u5sL7InZhmrKKWw6a4jJujqJ%2BXmr9usMSsmquhkprAbr%2FEnqCnn12crqOu2GannqyZqby0edWapWaqlayuta%2FHoqWgZaSntrF51aKbnqddnnqou9NmmqGhnKHAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dells-32-inch-8k-up3218k-display-now-for-sale.html><span>←</span><span>Dells 32-inch 8K UP3218K Display Now For Sale: Check Your Wallet</span></a>

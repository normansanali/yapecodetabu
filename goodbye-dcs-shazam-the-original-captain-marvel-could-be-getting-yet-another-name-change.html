Today, the name is associated with the Marvel superhero Carol Danvers because Marvel trademarked the moniker in 1967, but that wasn’t always the case.</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=635 data-injectable=true>Back in the day, Billy Batson made his first foray into print as Captain Marvel in&nbsp;Whiz Comics #2&nbsp;in February 1940. Comic book fans quickly became enamored with the story of an adolescent boy who could transform into a heroic figure like Superman. <a href=#>The original Captain Marvel</a> was created by Fawcett Publication and amassed a big following. It sold 1.3 million copies a week by 1944.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=287 data-injectable=false>However, the character’s likeness to Superman led to a legal battle with the Man of Steel’s original publisher Detective Comics (which later became DC Comics). Fawcett Publications reached an out-of-court settlement and discontinued the publication of Captain Marvel in 1953.</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>Fortunately, Batson returned to action in the 1970s. DC Comics licensed the character from Fawcett and incorporated him into their franchise. He underwent a rebrand and became Shazam in 1972. The name has stuck until now.</p><p data-characters=97 data-current-count=97 data-injectable=false>Fans are delighted that Billy will have a name he can say aloud without turning into a superhero.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Doctor_Of_Fate’s comment from discussion "Potential new name for Shazam in the comics going foward"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=91 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>Other fans were unimpressed and suggested that Billy should be called The Champion instead.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>IronAnkh’s comment from discussion "Potential new name for Shazam in the comics going foward"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>Another proposed a return to the character’s original name before publication: Captain Thunder.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>thecharlaton’s comment from discussion "Potential new name for Shazam in the comics going foward"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=91 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>Still, others suggested that DC Comics stick with Shazam and, if need be, Captain Thunder.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>SevereEducation2170’s comment from discussion "Potential new name for Shazam in the comics going foward"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>There’s something nostalgic about Billy Batson reclaiming a small part of his original name. After all, he became a hero during World War II, which makes The Captain hit differently. Most fans seem open to changing his name but a good number are not convinced that The Captain is a good fit. Time will tell where DC Comics lands on this issue.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTpLqqr8GopqSrX5y8sLDBspxmnJOoerS0wLOYpmWknbJuu9GinqKmkaF6pK3PrZiipl2irrPCxKVknKelobFursRmnp6spJ67qHnYnqtmmZ6kwamx0WalmqWVYrCprc2gnGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./giada-de-laurentiis-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Giada De Laurentiis Bio (Wiki)</span></a>

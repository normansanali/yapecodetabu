My lines were like, ‘Oh, Howard,’ ‘Oh, children, you’re not eating,’” she explained.</p><p>The 89-year-old actress, who played Mrs. Cunningham for 11 seasons, eventually got on better terms with her costar. “So we had to work our way through that. Because I learned to love him, I loved him and we became very close friends,” she added.</p><p>Ross also said she asked the show’s creator, <strong>Garry Marshall</strong>, if their roles could be expanded: “At one point I asked him, as we went on a few years, I said, ‘Could you think Tom and I could have more to do in the show?’ And he said, ‘It’s not about you. It’s about the boys.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/marion-tom.jpg><p>The&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;alum had a surprise reunion with a couple of members of the cast when Kelly brought out <strong>Anson Williams</strong> and <strong>Don Most</strong>, who portrayed Potsie Weber and Ralph Malph, respectively.

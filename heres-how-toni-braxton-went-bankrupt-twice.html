She invested heavily in staging her own show in Las Vegas, but she soon got sidelined by health problems. The show ran for about 18 months before Braxton was diagnosed with a heart condition called microvascular angina, which is where blood vessels in the heart become more narrow (via <a href=#>ABC News</a>). She later discovered that she also had lupus, an autoimmune disorder. With her health in jeopardy, Braxton stepped away from the stage.</p><p dir=ltr>When she filed for bankruptcy a second time in 2010, Braxton owed somewhere between $10 million to $50 million (via <a href=#>BBC</a>). As she explained to Entertainment Tonight, "It was about a business bankruptcy more than anything because I was doing my show in Vegas and I was forced to cancel my show because of my illness and all of my other concerts after that" (via the&nbsp;<a href=#>New York Daily News</a>). Around the same time, Braxton made her reality TV debut with her new series "Braxton Family Values."</p><p dir=ltr>With the success of her TV series, Braxton was able to emerge from bankruptcy a second time. But money troubles continue to plague the star. According to <a href=#>E! Entertainment</a>, Braxton struggled with tax issues in 2019 as the IRS and the state of California both filed tax liens against her. At the time, Braxton owed the federal government $340,200 and California $116,100 in back taxes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCkWlpbm1fnbKzsdJmn6ivXam8r7WMm6masKSku27DxKerZpqRo7izwc%2BtZK2vmZiycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andrea-koppel.html><span>←</span><span>Does Andrea Koppel Share Any Kids With Husband, Kenneth M.

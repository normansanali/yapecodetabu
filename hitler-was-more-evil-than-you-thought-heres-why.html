When prisoners were taken to the concentration camps, their hair was shaved off. Though part of this was a way to dehumanize Jews and other victims, there was another more sinister reason for the move.&nbsp;According to&nbsp;<a href=#>The New Yorker</a>, the hair would be "cured" above the camp's crematorium and then gathered into bales. From there, it was spun into thread and used for purposes such as making rope for ships, stuffing mattresses, and even creating detonating cords for time-delayed bombs.&nbsp;</p><p>But there were even creepier ways in which the hair-based thread was utilized, and that was in the clothing of Nazi troops. The thread was often used in socks for sailors who were stationed on submarines, as a lining in uniforms, and as an insulating material for cold-weather boots.&nbsp;Moreover, the use of hair was such a focus that "camp commanders were required to submit monthly reports on the amount of hair collected," according to the&nbsp;<a href=#>"Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp."</a>&nbsp;Piles of unused hair still remain today, as seen in <a href=#>these horrifying photos</a>.</p><p>The fact that Nazi leadership felt no guilt or shame in using the hair of dead victims for clothing and other items exemplifies how their warped mindset saw Jews and other so-called undesirables as less than human.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCkGpoa3Ffnba1uMSrZLCZo2K6sL7EZpyvoZxiwamtzWawqK1dqbWwwcahq2aglaeytHnWobBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./grayson-mccall-coastal-carolinas-star-quarterback-enters-the-transfer-portal-a-pivotal-decision.html><span>←</span><span>Grayson McCall, Coastal Carolina's Star Quarterback, Enters the Transfer Portal: A Pivotal Decision</span></a>

Survivor 45 was, which allowed the producers to bring new elements into the game like longer Hidden Immunity Idol hunts.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=559 data-injectable=true>So, if <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">season 46</a> wasn’t filmed with the extended episodes in mind, then we could get more time spent at camp and on the political maneuverings of the game, something Cesternino pointed out.</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>The fact that CBS had an extra 30 minutes to fill every week last season turned out to be a home run.

Even if you’ve not heard of the series before Clannad is worth checking out.</p><h2 id=h-how-to-watch-clannad-in-order data-injectable=false>How to watch Clannad in order?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=142 data-injectable=false>There are multiple ways in which you can watch the Clannad anime either chronologically or in order of release. Here are both of your options.</p><h3 id=h-release-viewing-order data-injectable=false>Release viewing order</h3><ul data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true><li>Season 1: Clannad (2007)</li><li>Clannad The Motion Picture (2007)</li><li>Season 2: Clannad: After Story (2008)</li><li>Clannad: Another World, Tomoyo Chapter (2008)</li><li>Clannad After Story: Another World, Kyou Chapter (2009)</li></ul><h3 id=h-chronological-viewing-order data-injectable=false>Chronological viewing order</h3><ul data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false><li>Season 1: Clannad (2007)</li><li>Clannad: Another World, Tomoyo Chapter (2008)</li><li>Clannad The Motion Picture (2007)</li><li>Season 2: Clannad: After Story (2008)</li><li>Clannad After Story: Another World, Kyou Chapter (2009)</li></ul><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true>The preferred order in which you should watch the Clannad series is the release order, however, you may want to skip the movie as it is mostly just a recap of season one and not necessary. Also, the OVA Chapters can both be watched after concluding season one as they are not directly connected to the main series, however, we recommend finishing both seasons before you check these two out.</p><p data-characters=76 data-current-count=76 data-injectable=false>Clannad is available for streaming on different platforms, such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Apple TV</a>.</p><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>However, if you run into any location-based restrictions trying to stream through either of these platforms, you might want to consider using a VPN (or Virtual Private Network). VPNs allow you to alter your viewing location to another country and access more shows & movies across your preferred streaming platforms. The easiest way to get a VPN is by signing up for a paid VPN service, such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">ExpressVPN</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">NordVPN</a>. Even better, both options offer a 30-day money-back guarantee.</p><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=152 data-injectable=false>We Got This Covered is supported by our audience.

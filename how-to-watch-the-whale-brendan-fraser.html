<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Stream the Oscar Winning Film</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The fabled "Brenaissance", otherwise known as the glorious comeback of beloved actor <a href=#><strong>Brendan Fraser</strong></a>, has really been ramping up in the past few years. While Fraser's return to the spotlight hit a minor speed bump with the historic and shocking cancelation of <strong>Batgirl</strong>, where he was initially set to join the Dark Knight's coterie of supervillains as Firefly, he still has enjoyed a wealth of successful roles in his comeback. He's still present in the world of DC as Robot Man in the cult favorite <strong>Doom Patrol</strong> (2019-2022) and had a starring role in the <strong>Steven Soderbergh</strong><strong> </strong>heist drama <strong>No Sudden Move</strong> (2021). It was also announced earlier this year that Fraser would be joining the already star-studded cast of <strong>Martin Scorsese</strong>'s next film, <strong>Killers of the Flower Moon</strong> (2023).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All those projects are exciting, but in the past few months, there has been one movie in particular that has been the talk of the industry. That movie is <a href=#><strong>The Whale</strong></a>, based on the award-winning stage play of the same name and directed by Academy Award-Nominated filmmaker <strong>Darren Aronofsky</strong> (Black Swan). Fraser will take on the lead role of Charlie; a six-hundred-pound suicidal English teacher who's trying to reconnect with his daughter, Ellie (<strong>Sadie Sink</strong>), before he effectively eats himself to death.</p><p>The movie made headlines at the 95th Annual Academy Awards taking home two Oscars. Though despite its success, it's been a more difficult movie to find compared to some of the other major contenders. Here's our guide to how you can watch the hard-hitting drama.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Editor's Note: This piece was last updated on March 13, 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/the-whale-sadie-sink.jpg><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="'The Whale': Cast, Plot, Release Date, and Everything We Know So Far ">'The Whale': Cast, Plot, Release Date, and Everything We Know So Far</a></span></p><h2 id=is-the-whale-still-in-theaters>Is The Whale Still in Theaters?</h2><p>Unfortunately, The Whale is no longer in wide release, but it is still playing in select theaters.</p><p>You can check out the film's official website to see if there:</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Buy Tickets</a></span></p><h2 id=is-the-whale-on-streaming>Is The Whale on Streaming?</h2><p>The Whale is now available to purchase on your platform of choice.

Starring Brendan Fraser and based on the acclaimed play by Samuel D. Hunter.</p><p>Original play creator <strong>Samuel D. Hunter</strong> being involved is a good indication that the feature adaptation of The Whale will be quite faithful to the original. Without giving too much away for those who would like to experience the film without knowing too much about the overall storyline, the play features a surprising amount of levity and humor despite obviously taking its topic and subject seriously. That seems to be the case for the film version as well, and other characters besides Charlie and his daughter Ellie, such as Charlie's pessimistic nurse Liz (Hong Chau) and an optimistic Mormon missionary named Elder Thomas (<strong>Ty Simpkins</strong>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=other-films-based-on-plays-you-can-watch-right-now>Other Films Based on Plays You Can Watch Right Now</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/the-whale-aronofsky.jpg><p><strong>Fences </strong>(2016): Directed by and starring <strong>Denzel Washington</strong>, Fences is an adaptation of the play from prolific playwright <strong>August Wilson</strong>. It follows the life of Troy Maxson (Washington); a hard-working but flawed working-class family man whose trying to be a strong husband to his wife, Rose (<strong>Viola Davis</strong>), and a strong father figure to his son, Cory (<strong>Jovan Adepo</strong>). That's his goal, but his execution winds up driving a wedge in his family as a whole, further estranging himself from people he will see in his home every single day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>A Streetcar Named Desire</strong> (1951): An classic in every sense of the word, A Streetcar Named Desire features two powerhouse performances from masters of their craft. Blanche (<strong>Vivien Leigh</strong>) is an aging southern belle who moves to New Orleans and in with her sister, Stella (<strong>Kim Hunter</strong>), and her physically abusive brother-in-law, Stanley (<strong>Marlon Brando</strong>). Leigh and Brando have remarkable chemistry with one another, with Blanche's desire to be young and beautiful pairing extremely well with Stanley's unapologetically vile bravado.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>The Boys in the Band</strong> (2020): Like The Whale, The Boys in the Band tackles life as a member of the LGBTQ+ community and the challenges one faces for being a part of that community. It follows a group of friends celebrating a birthday party in their cramped apartment, only for it to quickly become an exercise in remembering the past and the painful memories that exist therein. Consisting of a strong ensemble cast including <strong>Jim Parsons</strong>, <strong>Zachary Quinto</strong> (Star Trek), <strong>Matt Bomer</strong> (Doom Patrol), <strong>Andrew Rannells </strong>(The Book of Mormon), and more, it successfully displays the pros and cons of being a gay man in America.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51ktbDDjK2mZq%2BRqbCpedOhnGavmJa5pnnBq5ynnJGjeqe%2BwKycq2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sister-wives-gwendlyn-browns-savage-quotes-about-her-family.html><span>←</span><span>Sister Wives Gwendlyn Browns Savage Quotes About Her Family</span></a>

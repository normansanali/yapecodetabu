And that is dangerous.”</p><p>Peterson explained that after she got the ink, her eyes swelled up so much that she had to go to the hospital.</p><p>“I’m kind of recovered — on the outside, it’s recovered. It’s just inside. I’m basically on the verge of going blind,” she claimed.</p><p>In another instance, one Polish woman allegedly went blind after undergoing the same procedure — and ended up suing her tattoo artist, who was found guilty of inflicting permanent disability, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mirror reported.</a></p><p>As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WebMD</a> notes, there aren’t any eye inks approved by government agencies.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The TikToker showcased the tattoo artist giving her eyeballs some ink. <span class=credit>ja.m43/TikTok via ABC7</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">She was met with backlash from viewers in the comments. <span class=credit>ja.m43/TikTok via ABC7</span></figure><p>In Kiki’s case, some commenters complimented the bold look — with one person even envisioning getting the same thing done to their eyeballs.</p><p>“I want this so bad,” they disclosed.</p><p>Another asked, “Does it hurt?

<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Final Words and Conclusion - iBuyPower Element Gaming PC Review: i7-8086K and GTX 1080 Ti Inside</h1></header><section class=post-content><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>iBuyPower and system builders like them present users with an expedient option for buying a custom PC, taking all the building and testing hassle away and just leaving the 'plug it in and play' portion for the user. iBuyPower&nbsp;gives potential buyers a broad array of options to choose from including the case, down to wire lighting so it can really be a one-stop&nbsp;shop for those who may not want to build or feel uncomfortable building their own PC.&nbsp;</p><p>The Element system we have runs for $2199. If someone&nbsp;decided to build a system like this themselves, the cost would be around $250 less, but of course it wouldn't be built, configured, and tested out of the box&nbsp;for you. It takes hours to install hardware properly and route cables neatly as well as additional time to set up your OS and system, including overclocking as you like it. In some cases that process can be rewarding, and in other cases the desired reward is saving that time – albeit at an additional expense&nbsp;– something that can be worthwhile even for those who can put together their own PC. There is also a matter of tech support which a system builder provides, but when building your own, users are generally left to fend for themselves and find homes in forums such as ours.&nbsp;<span>This is the value system builders can bring to the user.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/13008/Element_Main_1200-gaming-pcs_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>We saw in our performance testing the iBuyPower system performs as it should out of the box which is what is to be expected. The overclock to 5 GHz for all cores on the Core i7-8086K processor improves performance across the board, making quick work against the lower clocked stock i7-8700K. One item of note with overclocking this system is to be sure adequate cooling is selected. Though the 120mm CLC&nbsp;kept things under the throttling point after a bit of tweaking, it was already at the limits so a warmer than average room (my office is kept at ~22C) it may be a tipping point. Because of this overclocking further, expecting to pass a stress test under 90C was a reach. Cooler is usually better and I would recommend a 2x120/140mm CLC&nbsp;for this processor if you want it to run at 5 GHz with&nbsp;little worry.</p><p>So where does that leave us? As someone who has built PCs with my own hands for well over 20 years, it can be difficult to find a lot of value in any system builder. But taking a step back and putting myself in the other 90% of people's shoes who do not have the experience and the worry removed from building a system and getting it set up for you can be priceless. The amount of time it can save and still have a quality system on your desk can easily be worth the price premium.&nbsp;The website, though it can be intimidating with so many options, was easy to work through and build systems with.&nbsp;Users can select to choose within the framework of their signature lines or build a completely custom system using the substantial catalog of parts they offer. Be it an AMD, Intel, or NVIDIA fan, small form factor or full tower, iBuyPower can put together some great looking and performing PCs and have done so with the nicely configured Element we had to play with.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH50fI9xZqKapa69sMPEq2SepJWisq%2FAjKCYpqGenHqxr4yrnK%2Bhlax6eXyXb6JmmZ6ZeqjA12ZoaXBgqbZutc2soJ2dX20%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dana-white-conor-mcgregor-next-fight-ufc-news.html><span>←</span><span>Dana White makes stern Conor McGregor return announcement after talks with UFC following Michael Cha</span></a>

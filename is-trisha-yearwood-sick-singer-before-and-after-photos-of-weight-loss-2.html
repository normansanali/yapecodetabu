<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Is Trisha Yearwood Sick? Singer Before And After Photos Of Weight Loss</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Trisha Yearwood is a 57 years old singer, actress, author, and television personality, born in Monticello, Georgia, United States, on the 19th of September 1964.</p><p>Yearwood rose to prominence when her debut single, “She’s in Love with the Boy,” became Billboard’s no. 1 on the country singles chart.</p><p>Her other country hits include Walkaway Joe, Believe Me Baby (I Lied), The Song Remembers When, and XXX’s and OOO’s (An American Girl). Likewise, Trisha has published three successful cookbooks and has a culinary television series called Trisha’s Southern Kitchen.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-trisha-yearwood-sick></span>Is Trisha Yearwood Sick?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Trisha Yearwood is not sick, but she tested Covid positive back in 2021, and it’s the only time news about her illness surfaced on the internet.</p><p>Yearwood was born healthy and has maintained her excellent health throughout the 57 years of her life; she has never disclosed suffering through any illness or health crisis.</p><p>Moreover, the singer recently made her stage appearance at a concert in Arlington, Texas, making her fans go crazy. Furthermore, she has expanded her horizon from making music and appearing on television, hosting a cooking show, and writing cookbooks.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-trisha-yearwood-underwent-weight-loss-surgery></span>Did Trisha Yearwood Underwent Weight Loss Surgery?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Since Trisha has lost a visible amount of weight in the past few years, some believe she has undergone a weight loss surgery, but it doesn’t seem to be the case.</p><p>The singer seems to have followed a yo-yo dieting and created her eating plan to get the body she has today.&nbsp;A source shared&nbsp;that she decided to lose weight when she was 15 and did Scarsdale, weight watchers, and Atkins.</p><p>Furthermore, she went from having&nbsp;bacon and cheese every day to wanting only a piece of toast, but she belongs to a family genetically and habitually predisposed to be heavy.</p><p>After following multiple diet plans and going hardcore on herself, she made her comeback with a healthier body during the 2013 Academy of Country Music Awards. And the following day, she woke up to headlines, ‘Trisha Yearwood’s Figure Steals the ACM Awards Show.’ Thus, it’s not the surgery she had to lose her body mass but her effort and dedication over many years.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=trisha-yearwood-health-update></span>Trisha Yearwood Health Update<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yearwood is healthy and doing fine, but she hasn’t remained consistent in her musical career; the last time she dropped a song was in August 2021 while releasing a deluxe edition of Every Girl.</p><p>However, earlier this week, the singer performed at a concert in Arlington, Texas, and shared a glimpse of the performance on her social media by posting a picture of her flaunting skin-tight black leather pants with an all-black outfit.</p><p>Trisha sang one of her biggest hits, ‘She’s in Love with a Boy,’ with other songs. Besides that, she is active on her Food Network cooking show Trisha’s Southern Kitchen. Thus, the performer does not appear to be suffering any acute illness that would affect her physically and mentally.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-trisha-yearwood-have-cancer></span>Does Trisha Yearwood Have Cancer?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yearwood hasn’t revealed if she is a cancer patient or disclosed any information on suffering through a life-threatening disease, so we presume she is cancer free.</p><p>However, her mom got&nbsp;diagnosed with breast cancer&nbsp;in 2009 and lost her battle with the disease in 2011. Likewise, her dad got diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and unfortunately, he lost his dad in 2005.</p><p>Furthermore, Trisha is a sincere artist who has remained transparent to her fans and often shares every little detail she encounters throughout her life. So, since she hasn’t opened up about her sickness, we shall remain assured that she is in good health and living her life to the fullest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGjYsGztdKhmGaxlZa%2FuLvOnWSsoZOgerS1zaCcq2WSmrOwvsRmmKecXZaztbHRZqehp6SkwG67xWaunqGXncFuuM6sqmZqXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./frida-sahagun-net-worth-328910.html><span>←</span><span>Frida Sahagn Net Worth</span></a>

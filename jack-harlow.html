Jack was a local star during high school and frequently performed to packed <a href=#>houses</a> at Louisville venues, including Mercury Ballroom, Headliners, and the Haymarket Whiskey Bar. He released a mixtape titled 18 in June 2016, less than a month after receiving his high school diploma, and it became the first release under his label, Private Garden. He made multiple trips to Atlanta over the following year to collaborate with engineer and mixer KY Engineering.</p><p>He released many singles in 2017, including “Hitchcock ” with 2forwOyNE and J-Reid, “Dark Knight ” and its accompanying music video, and the mixtape “Gazebo” in November. The Homies, made up of Louisville rappers and producers Ace Pro, 2forwOyNE, Shloob, Quiiso, and Ronnie Lucciano, opened for him on his subsequent 14-day Gazebo Tour. He worked on his upcoming songs in 2018 and 2019, acquired a contract with Atlantic Records and Dj Drama, and dropped his significant first mixtape, “Loose.” Following the release of many singles, Harlow issued “Confetti,” a 12-track mixtape featuring Bryson Tiller, 2forwOyNE, and EST Gee. The song “What’s Poppin,” which Jack co-wrote with Cole Bennett and released in January 2020, had sold over 95 million copies as of September 2020.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jack Harlow Relationship Status:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>single</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>There is no evidence that Jack Harlow is <a href=#>dating</a> anyone. He has been associated with the rapper Saweetie, though, and he allegedly had a relationship with TikToker <a href=#>Addison Rae</a>.</p><p>Jack Harlow has a history of ‘flirting’ with various individuals, including rapper Saweetie. When the two of them were spotted together at the BET Awards in June 2021, rumors began circulating. With Saweetie, who had broken up with rapper Quavo just a few months before June, Jack looked to have tried to “act like a gentleman” with an uninterested Saweetie.</p><p>According to rumors, Jack had an affair with Addison Rae in April 2021. When they were observed at a boxing fight in Atlanta the same month, the myth got its start. Addison liked many of Harlow’s posts on social media and followed her for a time. The public may have been misled into thinking they were dating, given how frequently they were seen together at the time. On the other hand, Rae made it clear that they were not dating by tweeting, “I’m single” on her Twitter account.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jack Harlow Social Appearance:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"></figure><p>Jaeden maintains a solid following across several social media sites, contributing to his established online presence.

The actress won for her role in </span><span>Everything Everywhere All at Once</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Before taking the stage to the delight of the audience,</span><a href=# rel>&nbsp;Curtis grabbed her co-star, Michelle Yeoh, and planted a big kiss</a><span> on her.</span></p><p><span>"I kissed her?, Did I really kiss her?" Curtis joked to ET's Denny Directo, backstage during the ceremony. "I love Michelle Yeoh. We love each other. We fell in love with each other. She's married.&nbsp;I met her husband in England, he's lovely. I also have a husband."</span></p><p><span>Curtis didn't just show her&nbsp;</span><span>Everything Everywhere All at Once</span><span> co-star love prior to taking the stage. She also took a moment to praise her while accepting her speech, noting that Yeoh is the reason she signed on for the film.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The veteran actress was up against&nbsp;Angela Bassett, Kerry Condon, and co-star Stephanie Hsu in the Supporting Actress category, and spoke about the bond she has built with each of the women over&nbsp;the course of promoting their respective films.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"I wanted to acknowledge that the women with me have become my friends and I didn't know that was gonna happen," she said in her speech. "I knew Stephanie of course, but I didn't know the rest of these women and we met over Zoom. We met in these panels and we met talking about each of our lives and our work. And I've become friends with them."</span></p><p><span>"Like Huang has a little baby, she had a baby right before making that movie. Angela came with her daughter, just&nbsp;beautiful, grown teenaged daughter, who I thought. 'Oh,&nbsp;can you imagine having Angela Bassett as my mother? As this force of beauty and strength in nature?' And Kerry&nbsp;Condon,&nbsp;&nbsp;we run at each other kind of like school girls. We've become friends and that is the nicest thing to take away and I'm telling you this is lovely and heavy."</span></p><p><span>Curtis continued on about sisterhood in the industry, noting, "But the truth of the matter is, for me in the season of shiny things and all of this tremendous amounts of attention, the nicest thing is that now I feel like I have girlfriends. There is a sisterhood for sure and on top of it of course, my cast who I love and who we've been with for three years together on this project."</span></p><p><span>Jamie and the</span><span>&nbsp;Everything Everywhere All at Once</span><span>&nbsp;cast&nbsp;all took home the biggest award of the evening for Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In addition to her&nbsp;two major wins, fans&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel>loved Curtis' take on the nepo-baby </a><span>conversation. Following her opening monologue -- where she gave a nod to her parents Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh -- she dished to ET about taking the title with stride.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"I joke about it because it's the thing that people like to joke about," she told ET. "But the truth of the matter is, I've been doing this for a very long time and I've never worked for anybody I ever knew. I mean, no one. I've only worked with strangers and so the truth of the matter is obviously it was a help. Obviously I know a lot about show-off business. I'm not gonna pretend that there was no effect of having them as my parents but I'm 64 years old I've been an actress since I was 19."</span></p><p><span>Curtis also paid tribute to her parents with her style, wearing the ring her father gave her mother when they were married.&nbsp;"As I was dressing and putting on my beautiful jewelry from Kathy Waterman to accompany my outfit, there was this ring," she said. "And I don't wear it, I don't wear pinkie rings and it was the ring that my father married my mother with. And I just put it on because&nbsp;I thought I'd bring them with me and not for good luck just to have them be in the room."</span></p><p><span>Also this weekend, ET's Nischelle Turner spoke to Curtis at the&nbsp;2023 Producers Guild Awards, where she dished on what props she </span><span>may</span><span> have taken from the&nbsp;</span><span>Everything Everywhere All at Once&nbsp;</span><span>set.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"I might have a pair of hotdog hands," she quipped before gushing further about the film and her castmates. "I love it. I'm 64 years old, I've been in this since I was 19 years old I'm on a red carpet with Ke Huy Quan talking about a movie about love and kindness."</span></p><p><strong><span>RELATED CONTENT:&nbsp;</span></strong></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>SAG Awards</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Jamie Lee Curtis Proudly Declares Herself a 'Nepo Baby' at SAG Awards</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>SAG Awards</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Jamie Lee Curtis Kisses Michelle Yeoh to Celebrate 2023 SAG Awards Win</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>Awards</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Jamie Lee Curtis Reacts to ‘True Lies’ Reboot at 2023 SAG Awards</span></h3></a><p class=label>Video</p><a class=title href=#>SAG Awards: Angela Bassett and Jamie Lee Curtis on Ariana DeBose's BAFTAs Rap (Exclusive)</a>Related Photos<a href=# aria-label="2023 SAG Awards: Biggest Fashion Moments"><span class=slidecount>23 Photos</span></a><a href=# aria-label="2023 SAG Awards: Biggest Fashion Moments"><span>2023 SAG Awards: Biggest Fashion Moments</span></a><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7psDOp6OippVjsLC5jqOYpqGVYrmmsYycrKusmah6s7HAnKusZaSkeqy10qygp59doraktMSlo55lqZq8qXnAn6ueql2orqh5wLCYq5yjYsSquoyer5ykpai2t7GManBycGds</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-the-dont-worry-darling-drama.html><span>←</span><span>Harry Styles' 'Spitgate' And All The Scandals Of Don't Worry Darling</span></a>

Country superstar <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jason Aldean</strong></a> gave fans a glimpse into his family Easter celebration on Instagram, including adorable photos of his children. It’s incredible to see how much all four of the kiddos have grown, but especially daughters <strong>Keely</strong> and <strong>Kendyl</strong>, who are now 18 and 13 years old, respectively.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Keely looked gorgeous in an off-the-shoulder, mint minidress featuring a ruffle hem and balloon sleeves. Kendyl is so cute in her white sundress and hair clipped back! The “Dirt Road Anthem” singer’s other photos from Easter Sunday (April 4) showed all the kids gearing up for an egg hunt, for which the girls both changed into tees and shorts.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Keely, who <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>just turned 18</a> in February, is already following in her father’s footsteps. Well, kind of. “She just came up to me a couple months ago and said she wanted to start learning how to play guitar,” Jason told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Taste of Country Nights</a> in 2018. “I was like, ‘Well, okay, what do you want to learn? Do you want to learn how to play rhythm? Rhythm acoustic, kinda like I play?’ She was like ‘No. I want to play like <strong>Slash</strong>, from <strong>Guns N’ Roses</strong>.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jason-Aldean-daughters-keely-kendyl-easter-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Needless to say, Jason was in over his head at that point. With the help of YouTube, he set her off in the right direction, though! “It’s pretty cool that she’s just showing interest in it,” the proud father said. “I think any time that you can learn to play an instrument, no matter what it is, that’s only going to be a great thing.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Jason shares eldest daughters Keely and Kendyl with ex-wife <strong>Jessica Aldean</strong>. Jason married wife <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brittany Kerr Aldean</strong></a> in 2015.

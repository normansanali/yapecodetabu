She explains, "I had many horses. There was one horse named Bones. Growing up on a farm, you have ups and downs. There's good things and very sad things."</p><p>Then, tragedy strikes: "I was at a cheerleading competition, and my mom, in the audience, was mouthing something, and I didn't really understand, and I was like, 'What?' and she was like, 'BONES IS DEAD. BONES DIED.'" Jennifer says she didn't cry at the time, being mid-competition, and later tried to ask her mother what caused her to unleash such unexpected news at that time. Sadly, she never got a straight answer!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>In 2014, some Reddit users <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unearthed a photo</a> of Jennifer in her high school cheerleading uniform, the same year she was spotted at multiple Louisville Cardinals basketball games performing cheers in the stands.

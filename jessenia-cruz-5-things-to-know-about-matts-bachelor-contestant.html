The former football player invited both of the ladies to a sit-down after Jessenia told Matt that MJ, 23, was involved in the “varsity vs. JV” drama in the house.</p><p>“MJ loves to preach about leading by example, but she’s the one who created that division. She started it,” Jessenia told Matt on the episode. “Everything she’s done has come from a place of malice.”</p><p>While the Wake Forest alum ultimately picked Jessenia over MJ, the hairstylist took one last opportunity to slam her in front on-camera.</p><p>“He’s still a great guy. I do want the best for him, and it’s disappointing he didn’t see it in me. My heart hurts. I don’t know how she did this,” MJ said. “She sabotaged me. That sucks, but Jessenia was petty. I hope he figures it out.”</p><p>While it’s possible the season 25 contestants have had more tension than other Bachelor casts, the women of Matt’s season came together earlier this month after <a href=#>Harrison’s headline-making interview</a> with <a href=#><strong>Rachel Lindsay</strong></a> about Rachael, who came under fire for <a href=#>attending an “Old South”-themed frat party</a> in 2018. After the host was accused of gaslighting the season 13 Bachelorette and downplaying Rachael’s actions, Harrison apologized to the fans and to Rachel. Jessenia and the cast, meanwhile, <a href=#>released a statement on Thursday, February 11.</a></p><p><strong>Us editors discuss Colton Underwood’s coming out in this Here for the Right Reasons podcast highlight!<strong><br></strong></strong></p><p>“Twenty-five women who identify as BIPOC were cast on this historic season that was meant to represent change. We are deeply disappointed and want to make it clear that we denounce any defense of racism,” the statement reads. “Any defense of racist behavior denies the lived and continued experiences of BIPOC individuals. These experiences are not to be exploited or tokenized. Rachel Lindsay continues to advocate with ‘grace’ for individuals who identify as BIPOC within this franchise. Just because she is speaking the loudest, doesn’t mean she is alone. We stand with her, we hear her, and we advocate for change alongside her.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Rachel, who was the first Black Bachelorette, thanked Jessenia for sharing the statement in the comments section of her post. Harrison, meanwhile, apologized for the second time on Saturday, February 13, as the backlash continued <a href=#>and announced he wouldn’t be featured on the upcoming live After the Final Rose </a>special.</p><p>The Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>Scroll through for five things to know about Jessenia:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BfsrS%2FxKegmmWTp8K7eZRmq6GhnpzAbsDOZqKnp6dirqO71K1kppmkqcBursCcn56kn6d6pLvNrZysrJGjwXB9jKyfnqtdqbWmecWoqaadomK6qr%2FSZpylZaCWwLB7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeff-goldblum-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Jeff Goldblum Net Worth 2024</span></a>

While development has been slow, things have started to ramp up over the last few months and Warner Bros’ has started whetting fans appetites. After releasing a <a href=# rel=noopener>handful of screenshots last month</a>, we’ve now been treated to two character posters – one of Josh Lawson as Kano and the other of Joe Taslim as Sub-Zero.</p>See more<p lang=en dir=ltr>Joe Taslim is Sub-Zero. <a href=#>#MortalKombatMovie</a> trailer Thursday. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/63Rv7Kwahs</a></p><p>— Mortal Kombat Movie (@MKMovie) <a href=#>February 17, 2021</a></p><h3>Who is Joe Taslim – The new Sub-Zero</h3><p>Joe Taslim was born in Indonesia in 1981 and is of mixed Palembang and Chinese descent. He’s multitalented and is both an actor and a martial artist. Taslim also undertakes modelling work.</p><p>While he’s not had too many roles that Western audiences will be familiar with, Taslim has appeared in a handful of films. Most notably he was in Fast & Furious 6 as an antagonist known as Jah and he also appeared in Star Trek Beyond as another villain, Manas/Anderson Le.</p><p>For those into action movies, Taslim appeared in the Indonesian hit The Raid. He played Sergeant Jaka, one of the main cast looking to infiltrate the building.</p><h3>Who else is in the Mortal Kombat Movie</h3><p>Starring alongside Joe Taslim is a range of actors, many of whom viewers may be unfamiliar with. Like Sub-Zero, we have been treated to a Kano character poster, this time featuring Australian actor Josh Lawson. Lawson had minor roles in Anchor Man 2 and TV-hit Superstore, but nothing else immediately recognisable to the general audience.</p><p>Alongside Lawson and Taslim, the movie features Lewis Tan as Cole Young, Jessica McNamee as Sonya, Tadanobu Asano as Raiden, Mehcad Brooks as Jax and Hiroyuki Sanada as Scorpion. There is also a range of other Mortal Kombat stalwarts represented in the movie.</p>See more<p lang=en dir=ltr>Josh Lawson is Kano. <a href=#>#MortalKombatMovie</a> trailer Thursday at 9am PT. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/C9DSFBtQYe</a></p><p>— Mortal Kombat Movie (@MKMovie) <a href=#>February 17, 2021</a></p><h3>Mortal Kombat Movie Details</h3><p>The release of the new posters was to make fans aware that the first trailer for the Movie will be arriving on Thursday, February 18. The title is set for <a href=# rel=noopener>release on April 16</a> and will be coming to movie theatres, as well as streaming <a href=# rel=noopener>exclusively on HBO Max</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pcHApaqhp5OgsrO%2FjZympmeapLJuwMCso6KlXajCo3nZnqmoZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-moment-jennifer-aniston-knew-her-marriage-to-justin-theroux-was-over.html><span>←</span><span>The Moment Jennifer Aniston Knew Her Marriage To Justin Theroux Was Over</span></a>

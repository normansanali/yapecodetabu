Kate replied, "Yeah, slightly terrifying, slightly terrifying, I’m not going to lie."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But despite her own fears about it, the Duchess of Cambridge revealed why she introduced all three of her children during the traditional royal photocalls. She revealed, "Everyone had been so supportive, and both William and I were really conscious that this was something that everyone was excited about. And, you know, we’re hugely grateful for the support that the public had shown us, and actually for us to be able to share that joy and appreciation with the public, I felt was really important. But equally it was coupled with a newborn baby, and inexperienced parents, and the uncertainty of what that held, so there were all sorts of mixed emotions."</p><img alt="The Duke And Duchess Of Cambridge Leave The Lindo Wing With Their Newborn Son" title="The Duke And Duchess Of Cambridge Leave The Lindo Wing With Their Newborn Son" width=2400 height=3600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-william-duke-of-cambridge-catherine-duchess-of-news-photo-1581864816.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Neil Mockford</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Kate Middleton and Prince William pose with Prince George in July 2013.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kate also revealed that she wanted to leave the hospital after giving birth. Per the duchess, "I was keen to get home because, for me, being in hospital, I had all the memories of being in hospital because of being sick [with acute morning sickness] so it wasn’t a place I wanted to hang around in.

As it turns out, the former couple has come up with a plan for them as well. In May 2022, Maloney revealed on an episode of Dear Media's podcast <a href=#>"Relationsh*t&nbsp;with Kamie Crawford"</a>&nbsp;that they planned to share custody of the dogs. "We still do things together,"&nbsp;Maloney explained about the arrangement. "We have some of the same group of friends, and we have dogs that we're gonna split custody of... He's family to me, and I'm always going to love him, so our friendship is very important to both of us." Here's to a smooth co-parenting (co-pupping?) journey for both parties. Fingers crossed!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhibH96hI6kmK2hlWK6orjOp5yyZZGjsW7AzqZkrJuYrK6zwNlmp66sXam1pnnFoqWapF2jrqq4jKKlZqyYmnqku8WfoKdln5t6tbTEoqlmpZGnv6qtxp5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./veja-sneakers-zappos-cyber-monday-sale-8399156.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Middleton Wears Veja Sneakers That Are Up to 78% Off</span></a>

He was 81.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The sad news was announced by a spokesperson for Takada's home and lifestyle brand K-3, which launched just last year. "It is with immense sadness that the brand K-3 announces the loss of its celebrated artistic director, Kenzo Takada. The world-renowned designer passed away on October 4th, 2020 due to COVID-19 related complications at the age of 81 at the American Hospital, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France," a statement read, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>CNN</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Takada's death comes 50 years after founding his label Jungle Jap, which later became known as Kenzo. He launched his first collection of designs swathed in bold colors and mismatched patterns in Paris during the 1970s, and he went on to open a flagship store in the city's Place des Victoires six years later.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1993, Takada's fashion empire — which also consisted of fragrance and menswear lines — was acquired by luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. He left the brand in 1999, but continued to lend his support to the creative departments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was a fan of the brand in the Seventies when he started. I think he was a great designer,” said Sidney Toledano, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Fashion Group in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>WWD</a>. “I’m very sad. He was a great guy.” The trailblazing designer attended the debut show of new creative director Felipe Oliveira Baptista in February, but was too ill to make it to last week's spring 2021 runway.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3yssc2zpmaskaCupa2MnaCenF2YvLO7zZqtoqqlqHqku8ypo6Kbkam2sLrS</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rainbow-six-extraction.html><span>←</span><span>Does Rainbow Six Extraction Have PvP?</span></a>

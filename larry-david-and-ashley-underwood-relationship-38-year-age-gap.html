And, in truth, Larry actually did. After all, many of <a href=#>the best episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm</a> deal with Larry dating, and most of them are actually based on reality. Larry's real-life experiences, such as when he worked on <a href=#><strong>Saturday Night Live</strong></a>, have inspired the most frustrating, ridiculous, and utterly hilarious moments in both Curb and Seinfeld.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Larry is unlikely to find too much comedic inspiration from dating now that he's happily married to Ashley Underwood. Larry's relationship with the somewhat mysterious woman could, however, bring a new type of comedic inspiration. This is because she's a whopping 38 years younger than him.</p><p>It's remarkable how little the press knows about Ashley Underwood. A lot of the same information about Ashley and her relationship with the beloved 73-year-old misanthrope is regurgitated and circulated. But a little more digging reveals more about their atypical relationship, which is <a href=#>actually his second marriage</a>. Let's take a look...</p><h3 id=update-2023-06-26-18-30-est-by-lane-vasquez>UPDATE: 2023/06/26 18:30 EST BY LANE VASQUEZ</h3><p><strong>Ashley Underwood And Larry David Are Happily Married Despite Their Age Gap</strong></p><p>As of 2023, Ashley Underwood and Larry David are still happily—if quietly—together. After a rollercoaster of a pandemic experience, including their wedding, the two seem to be lying low.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-larry-david-and-ashley-underwood-meet>How Did Larry David And Ashley Underwood Meet?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/instar49659466.jpg><p>Larry David fans know that he absolutely hates parties, but he has a social gathering to thank for meeting his new wife. While there's little <a href=#>information out there about Larry David and his wives</a>, we do know that he met Ashley at Sacha Baron Cohen's birthday party in 2017.</p><p>Ashley Underwood has an exceptionally strong relationship with the Ali G Show star and his wife, Isla Fisher. While we don't know how they first met, Ashley is credited as a producer on both Baron Cohen's film Borat Subsequent Movie Film and his TV show Who Is America?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Despite Seinfeld's Success, Larry David's Sour Grapes Was A Box Office Disaster And A Massive Disappointment For The Cast</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A look through Ashley's Instagram page shows that she wasn't always in the entertainment world. In fact, it appears as though she went to John Marshall Law School which is part of the University of Illinois, Chicago.</p><p>Although she graduated and was seemingly on her way to becoming a lawyer, Ashley had a love of writing comedy and started to pursue that. A few short years later, she was working on two of Sacha Baron Cohen's most beloved projects and getting invited to hang out with a bunch of other famous comedic minds... most notably her future husband.</p><p>"We were seated next to each other [at the party]," Larry explained in the interview. "Much to her surprise I left before dessert. I was doing so well, banter-wise, I didn't want to risk staying too long and blowing the good impression."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon after, they started dating and fell in love. By 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley moved into Larry's Pacific Palisades home</a>, according to People. And that was fortunate, because soon after the global pandemic hit.</p><h2 id=larry-and-ashley-got-married-during-the-pandemic>Larry And Ashley Got Married During The Pandemic</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Larry-David.jpg><p>Everyone was surprised to learn of Larry David and Ashley Underwood's secret wedding in October 2020. Mostly because barely anybody knew that they were dating, to begin with. But Larry did tell The New York Times what it was like to quarantine with Ashley during the beginning of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Larry's eldest daughter, Cazzie, was also living at the Pacific Palisades house with them and this created a whole new dynamic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"There’s not a moment in the day when there isn’t friction between at least two of us," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Larry explained</a>. "Then when that gets resolved, two others are at each other’s throats and it’s invariably about dishes. 'You didn’t do the dishes!' Or 'You didn’t help with the dishes!'"</p><p>Larry was also unhappy with Ashley whenever she started a show without him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Larry David's Relationship With Vivica A. Fox</a></span></p><p>Still, none of this stopped them from tying the knot at a small ceremony in October 2020. While nobody has confirmed the precise location, it appears to have been in Larry and Ashley's backyard. Among the attendees was the famous couple that brought them together in the first place, Sacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher, according to photos on Ashley's Instagram.</p><p>At the wedding, Larry wore a beautiful navy blue suit and Ashley looked radiant in her white wedding dress. It was officiated by a female justice of the peace under a stunning flowered archway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-ashley-get-along-with-larry-39-s-kids>Does Ashley Get Along With Larry's Kids?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jpg_20230227_003429_0000.jpg><p>While Larry David doesn't have social media (obviously) a lot can be learned about his relationship with Ashley from her Instagram. This includes the relationship she has with the most important people in Larry's life.</p><p>Even though neither Cazzie nor Larry's other daughter Romy follows their stepmother's Instagram account (nor does she follow them), a photo of Ashley shows them all together. They all seem quite happy, and the caption reads, "My new year’s resolution was to delete Instagram but then I got this cute pic with my 3 favorite people."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Cazzie did quarantine with her father and Ashley, neither she nor her sister has publicly made a comment about their new step-mom, so it's impossible to know <a href=#>how well they actually get along</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is Larry David's Ex-Wife Really Doing Now?</a></span></p><p>Ashley has also impacted Larry's life in a way that his fans thought would never happen... having animals around the house. Ashley is a massive dog lover and has made sure that Larry is open to having animals around the house.</p><p>Cazzie has even commented on the fact that Larry has uncharacteristically become attached to Ashley's Australian shepherd, Bernie (named after progressive Democrat, Senator Bernie Sanders). And, yes, Larry does walk Bernie. But, of course, if Larry wants to keep his relationship with the much younger woman going, he's going to have to keep doing things that he's not used to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-ashley-underwood-and-larry-david-still-together>Are Ashley Underwood And Larry David Still Together?</h2><p>As season 11 of Larry David's hit HBO comedy Curb Your Enthusiasm premiered in October 2021, Ashley Underwood accompanied her husband to the premiere at Paramount Pictures Studios. The two were also photographed together attending New York Fashion Week in September 2021, and a photo of David plugging his ears at the event went viral.</p><p>According to David's daughter Cazzie, the comedian looked like he was having a terrible time at fashion week, and she suggested he had been "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dragged to some place he doesn't want to be</a>."</p><p>While Cazzie didn't say who might have "dragged him" to this event, she could have been referring to Ashley Underwood, who was sitting right beside Larry.</p><p>The couple attended the 2022 Vanity Fair Oscars Party together in late March, but before then they had not made a major public appearance since the Curb Your Enthusiasm season 11 premiere back in 2021.</p><p>Clearly, they are still very much together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijmqqirnqlrdWim2aZnpl6or%2FHpZyyZaWjsaa%2B1qimnWWimrmiwMiopaygmaV6dISMspyaql2WtKZ5xpqnaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./donna-richardson-net-worth-income-html.html><span>←</span><span>Donna Richardson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>

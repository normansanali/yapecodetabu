In addition, he and his wife Lisa made an appearance on the television show “Real Housewives of Miami,” where he claimed that the criticism of his operation was unfounded. Not only that, but he owns Hochstein Med Spa.</p><p>The actress Lisa Hochstein, an American, was Leonard Hochstein’s long-term girlfriend. The two appeared on the reality series “Real Housewives of Miami.” In October 2009, Leonard tied the knot with Lisa. Logan is the couple’s son, and they were married ten years ago.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Leonard_Hochstein_start_his_Professional_Career>How did Leonard Hochstein start his Professional Career?</span></h2><p>Nicknamed the “Boob God” of Miami, Leonard recently sued Nicole George and Kristen La Pointe, two of his patients, alleging that their unfavorable Yelp reviews damaged his reputation.</p><p>In addition, La Pointe claimed in her evaluation that she had scars from the surgeon’s over-enlargement of her breasts. George, the second patient, on the other hand, says that after a procedure known as a “Mommy Makeover,” which entails a stomach tuck, breast lift, liposuction, and augmentation, the “doctor left her with disfiguring scarring and different breast sizes.”</p><p>The former patient acknowledged that before the procedure, she had to sign a nondisclosure agreement that prohibited her from posting a critical evaluation of Hochstein or any of his staff members.</p><p>The agreement stated that the patient must pay $25,000 for every unfavorable remark. George, however, signed the paper under the mistaken impression that it was common for plastic surgeons in general.</p><p>However, there are a lot of questions concerning the use of nondisparagement to manage reputation in the plastic surgery sector because of a Florida civil lawsuit involving Dr. Leonard and two of his patients.</p><p>American cosmetic surgeon “Boob God,” who is 52 years old, is well-known for his work in breast augmentation and implants for women of all ages.</p><p>In addition, the doctor has years of experience in the industry and works with several well-known models, porn stars, and celebrities.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Cecilia Allman, Marian Krawstor, and Bronlie Jacobs."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4226,"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"10":2,"15":"Arial"}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":62}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/cecilia-allman/"}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":"https://popularbio.com/marian-krawstor/"}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":"https://popularbio.com/bronlie-jacobs/"}{"1":62}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cecilia Allman</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Marian Krawstor</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Bronlie Jacobs</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Businessman</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Plastic Surgeon</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Monique Miles</a></h3>Monique Miles- Biography Monique Miles is an American lawyer, businesswoman, civil rights activist, Youth Mentor, social media celebrity, and media personality.

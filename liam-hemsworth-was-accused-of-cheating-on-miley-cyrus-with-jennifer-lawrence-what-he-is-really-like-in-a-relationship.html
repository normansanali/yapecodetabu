A lot has happened in the years that have followed, including allegations of what went wrong, with many fingers pointing at Hemsworth. This includes him allegedly having an affair with <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong></a>, who clarified when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they had a brief fling in an interview in June 2023</a>. Regardless, the whole thing between him and Cyrus was messy. But has the world forgotten all the amazing things that have been said about what it's like to be in a relationship with him?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apart from being genetically blessed, Hemsworth has been praised for his dedication and ambition. And he really tried to make his relationship work, which could prove he is serious about the people he gives his heart to. Here are all the good things about him that the world quickly forgot…</p><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence-denied-rumors-she-had-an-affair-with-liam-hemsworth>Jennifer Lawrence Denied Rumors She Had An Affair With Liam Hemsworth</h2><p>When Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth divorced, their actions came under a microscope, and people watched for signs that they were dissing each other. When Cyrus released her 2020 album "Plastic Hearts," fans began reading into the subtle messages in her songs.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Bruno Mars Really Feels About Miley Cyrus's "Flowers" And If The Song Is Really About Him</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>OK, but what about the cheating rumors</a>? Well, both sides have been accused of being unfaithful. Something which Miley Cyrus addressed on Twitter in 2019. "I can admit to a lot of things, but I refuse to admit that my marriage ended because of cheating," she wrote. "You can say I am a twerking, pot-smoking, foul-mouthed hillbilly, but I am not a liar. [...] I am proud to say, I am simply in a different place from where I was when I was a younger."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/miley-cyrus-denied-cheating-allegations-but-fans-uncovered-clues-hinting-at-a-liam-hemsworth-and-jennifer-lawrence-affair.jpg><p>The music Cyrus would release in 2023 on her new album "Endless Summer Vacation" made everyone take a look at their relationship once again. This time, fans believed even more evidence<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> suggested Hemsworth had been unfaithful</a>, specifically the lyrics to the track "Muddy Feet."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But it was Cyrus' "Flowers" video that seemed to call out Liam Hemsowrth's Hunger Games love interest Jennifer Lawrence as the other woman. Specifically, because Cyrus wore a dress similar to the one Lawrence was wearing while getting close to Hemsworth on the red carpet. However, these cheating rumors have swirled for a while.</p><p>In June 2023, Jennifer Lawrence clarified the timeline of her very brief thing with Liam Hemsworth. While talking to Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live during a promotion tour for No Hard Feelings, Lawrence claimed that Miley Cyrus' music video for "Flowers" was not meant as a reference to her and that she and Hemsworth did not have an affair.</p><p>"I mean, we all know <a href=#>me and Liam, like, kissed one time</a>. It was years after they'd broken up," Lawrence told Cohen.</p><h2 id=what-has-miley-cyrus-said-about-dating-liam-hemsworth>What Has Miley Cyrus Said About Dating Liam Hemsworth?</h2><p><a href=#>Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth were not meant to end up together</a>, despite them trying to make their relationship work. They were together off and on for over a decade.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Tish Cyrus's Fiancé Dominic Purcell Have A Positive Relationship With Miley and Her Siblings?</a></span></p><p>Cyrus and Hemsworth started dating in 2009 after meeting on the set of their film The Last Song. She was just 17 when the former couple split in 2010. At the time, a source told E! News, "Liam wanted more, but she's 17 and has other priorities right now. He's been a distraction."</p><p>But they would not stay broken up for long and got back together in September 2010. Then they broke up in November 2010. At some point, Cyrus and Hemsworth would reconcile, and things between them would be better than ever in May 2012 because they announced their engagement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/miley-cyrus-and-liam-hemsworth.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In April 2013, fans got another glimpse into the struggles of Cyrus and Hemsworth's relationship when they postponed their wedding. "They're still engaged and living together," a source told People at the time. "They just realized that there is no rush with the wedding and that it's better that they wait a bit."</p><p>"They don't want to get married until they figure out their problems," a second source shared.</p><p>"But Miley is very worried about losing Liam. She is crazy about him." After years of off-and-on relationships and other pairings, most notably from Miley's side, the couple would finally get married on December 26, 2018. Sadly, they realized just a few months later, in April 2019, that their relationship was not meant to be. For good this time, and filed for divorce, citing "irreconcilable differences."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/liam-hemsworth-and-miley-cyrus.jpg><p>But there was a time when Miley had a lot of good things to say about her former boyfriend/husband. Just take the time she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gushed about her attraction for him</a> in a 2013 interview with Cosmopolitan.</p><p>"I'll literally look at him and be like, 'You are hot, dear God!'" she said. "The other day, I turned on the pool heater, and it was steaming, and he walked outside and took off his clothes and jumped in the pool. I was like, 'I'm gonna faint — the hottest guy of my life is in a steaming pool. This looks like a Playgirl shoot.' So I took a photo and made it the background on my phone. My best friend grabbed my phone and was like, 'Who's that? He is so hot!' That's my hubby!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Liam Hemsworth And Girlfriend Gabriella Brooks' Life Is A Complete Mystery, Here's Whether Or Not They're Actually Still Together</a></span></p><p>Cyrus also praised Hemsworth for his ambition. "I like when men work hard," she told Us Weekly. "I think it's important. I always work really hard, so it's good to have someone who is as passionate about what they do and wants to be great at what they do instead of just being OK. We always strive to have our 130%."</p><p>Cyrus has praised Hemsworth for his reaction to their home burning down in the Woolsey wildlife fire disaster. In an interview with Jimmy Fallon in November 2018 (via Us Weekly), she said: "Liam was an amazing hero. He got all the horses, the pigs, seven dogs, four cats. His truck was [filled]. It was really sexy to me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-liam-hemsworth-said-about-being-in-a-relationship>What Has Liam Hemsworth Said About Being In A Relationship?</h2><p>It may be incredibly easy to focus on the negative things about Liam Hemsworth, given the more recent reports about his relationship with Miley Cyrus. However, there was a time when many would have considered him a real catch, and perhaps it's time to shift the focus back to this time.</p><p>There was a time when Hemsworth was completely committed to his relationship, and he and Cyrus did all they could to make it work. This showed the world he was serious about committing to someone he loved, and he really loved her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Jennifer-Lawrence-Ate-Mustard-And-Tuna-Before-Kissing-These-Actors-(Josh-Hutcherson-and-Liam-Hemsworth).jpg><p>Hemsworth also keeps his private life to himself, and over the years, he has proven how reluctant he is to speak to the media. That is not to say he never has, though, and he has had some lovely things to say about Cyrus in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a 2015 interview with Men's Journal, he confessed his strong feelings for the singer. "We were together five years," he explained, "so I don't think those feelings will ever change. And that's good because that proves to me that it was real. It wasn't just a fling. It really was an important part of my life and always will be."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijopmdYrWmudKwpqusmGLEor%2BMmpqcraOasW67xWaaoZ2Rqbavs4yopWalmaGyunnCsqmuq12strW0jKOcp6aZm7KzecuarqudnpiybsPHmqtmoJVitrR50Z6YpaSpYrmqt8RmoKdlkWK%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./letters-on-a-rush-order-html.html><span>←</span><span>Letters on a rush order</span></a>

The We TV personality revealed that she and her boyfriend broke up briefly, but he and Alana stayed in touch during that time. “Geno has stepped up,” she explained. “When we broke up for a little while, you know, when I was dating other people, he was still in Alana’s life. He’s kind of shown her over the last few years that, ‘No matter what, if I’m with your mom or not, that’s not going to change my relationship with you.’”</p><p>Mama June: From Not to Hot premieres on We TV on Friday, June 15, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSapZFit7a6xGarmqSbqHq4scOdoKefXaW5orrSZq6irJhitKa6zmabqJmbYsSiwMKhZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./karla-jara.html><span>←</span><span>Karla Jara Age | Wiki, Net worth, Bio, Height, Boyfriend</span></a>

Here's what we know about his dating life.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Mike Faist dating? He's pretty private.</h2><p>Though we've seen Mike get pretty intimate with some of his co-stars in Challengers, he's an incredibly private person when it comes to his personal life. Before he became an award-winning actor, Mike was pretty open about who he was dating online, sharing snaps with his partner and swapping public comments.</p><p>But as his following has grown, Mike's become much more secretive with his dating life —&nbsp;mostly because he doesn't have social media anymore!</p><p>“I don’t know anything specific as to what people will say, because I don’t go on the internet, I don’t have social media,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IndieWire</a> during the press tour for West Side Story. “I do a self-preservation thing, because … I think I learned my lesson a long time ago doing Dear Evan Hansen of just not paying attention to any of those things."</p><p>This also means you can speculate all you want about who Mike may be dating — he won't see it!</p><p>"I have to yell at my friends and family, ‘Don’t tell me anything. Stop contacting me about this. Please don’t,'” he continued.</p><p>But given that the actor is chronically offline, it's not clear if he has more romantic connections than those we've seen on-screen lately.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Mike was previously with Broadway dancer Tilly Evans-Krueger.</h2><p>Though we know little of his romantic life before he hit the small screen, when Mike was still in Dear Evan Hansen on Broadway, it seems he was in a relationship with choreographer and dancer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tilly Evans-Krueger</a>.</p><p>Based on some old <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tumblr</a> screenshots from 2017, it seems the couple were romantically linked for some time, even attending the Obie Awards that year together.</p><p>The photos screenshotted and shared to Tumblr include captions where Tilly refers to Mike as her "babe," "love," and "boyfwend." There are also a couple of images of them kissing, confirming that they were in a relationship.</p><p>Just how long they were connected, though, isn't clear. Though Tilly is still very active online, posting about her work choreographing The Outsiders musical, there are no photos with Mike on her page, suggesting that the pair have been separated for some time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforassYyfmKKrpGKxosDIp54%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-linden-ashby-doing-now-net-worth-wife-biography-501358-html.html><span>←</span><span>What is Linden Ashby doing now?

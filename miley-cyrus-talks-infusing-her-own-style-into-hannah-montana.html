And as I started to understand the magic of Hannah is actually the magic of me, I started infusing my own style into her style.”</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Cyrus starred as the titular character upon the show’s 2006 premiere on Disney Channel. The sitcom — which lasted for 4 seasons and spawned over 100 concerts, 5 soundtracks and a feature film — followed Miley Stewart (Cyrus) as she lives a double life and transforms herself into famous pop singer Hannah Montana.</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>While speaking with British Vogue, the Last Song star pointed to a custom-made<a href=#><strong> Jeremy Scott</strong></a> dress from season one of the series — which featured patterns of different road signs and a large collar — as the first time “I decided that I was going to have control over what I wear.”</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>While the “Party in the USA” songstress revealed that the “fabulous” gown came from a brutal “four-hour fitting” on the Hannah Montana set, she gushed over Scott, 47, and his “loyalty” at a time when “no designers understood dressing a teen pop star from a Disney TV show.”</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“But he did, and I think that’s part of her genius,” she added.</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Moving down her fashion timeline, the Grammy nominee also<a href=#> detailed a more daring look</a> from a 2010 concert in Paris. The outfit — which featured a crop top tee, leather shorts and four Beaumont belts from her “personal” collection — felt both “protective” and something that was “completely different” from her usual Hannah Montana style, Cyrus explained. </span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“This was my way of introducing myself as Miley to the world,” she continued. “I had been a character for so long, so this was the beginning of developing who Miley would be.”</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Since taking off the blonde wig, the “Younger Now” singer has crafted an increasingly dramatic&nbsp;style evolution over the years, often making it clear that <a href=#>she’s not afraid to lean into shock value</a> when it comes to fashion.</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>During a 2021 interview with<a href=#> Vogue</a>, Cyrus revealed <a href=#>that her wide-ranging style choices</a> are specifically made to reflect her personality at any point in time.</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Fashion to me is kind of like flipping yourself inside out. It’s like wearing your heart, wearing your guts, wearing your values, wearing your identity, wearing your pain, wearing you joy,” she shared. “There’s something kind of childlike about it. You’re so fearless when you get yourself dressed when you’re a kid. You don’t think about what someone will think of you or what they’ll judge.”</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>She added, “It’s just about expression and how you feel that day. <a href=#>There’s a fearlessness</a>. And so when I get dressed, I try to kind of think like my inner child and be genuine and authentic in whatever I’m wearing.”</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>When it comes to looking back on her time as Hannah Montana, the songwriter has mixed emotions about the show —&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>but only love for the character.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“You were like a rocket that <a href=#>flew me to the moon and never brought me back down</a>. … You and I have been through it all together, my friend. We’ve shared many firsts. A lot of lasts. Ups. Downs. Tears and laughs,” the former child star<a href=#> wrote via Instagram in a March 2021 open letter</a> to her on-screen counterpart. “Hannah, I hope you hear me and believe those words are true. You have all my love and upmost gratitude. Breathing life into you for those six years was an honor. … I love you, Hannah Montana.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6K2rbHYZpqyqqWoerWty6SqZqGem8K0tc2gZKGdomK8uLqMrKuypJVitq%2FAzmafmqaelrVuuc6nq5qmkWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leslie-jones.html><span>←</span><span>Leslie Jones Celebrity Profile Hollywood Life</span></a>

His Responses, However, Were Perceived As Lackluster, Leading Some Fans To Suggest That Fellow Driver Alex Bowman Might Have Been A Better Fit For The Video.</span></h2><h2 class="ffuju pa">A Detour to Remember</h2><h2 class="udnip pa"><span>Among The More Memorable Moments Was When Elliott Shared A Story About A Trip That Was Supposed To End In Bristol But Instead Took Him To New York. He Even Ran Into Former HMS Driver And 7-time Champion Jimmie Johnson At A Hooters Outlet. Despite The Amusing Anecdote, Fans Were Disappointed With Elliott's Overall Performance In The Video.</span></h2><h3 class="ekzcp pa"><span>SUBSCRIBE TO OUR 'NASCAR' NEWSLETTER NOW!</span></h3><h2 class="bjkux pa"></h2><a href=# class=cta-a>Click Here</a><h2 class="ljmon pa"><span>The Final Lap: Kevin Harvick's Farewell to NASCAR</span><br></h2><h2 class="zswoe pa">Dale Earnhardt Jr.: A Tale of Unseen Battles<br></h2><h2 class="xuqsz pa"><span>The Ultimate Showdown: NASCAR Titans Gibbs and Hendrick's Digital Handshake</span></h2><h2 class="btdqm pa"><span>READ MORE</span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue9Ktpquhlah8r63SnJirZZ6axLR5wqGYrJ1dmrmttc6tq2aklZbDpr%2BMp5ism5GneqetzaxknaGjpbmmrdKem2aZo2K6orCMpaCbq12WwbWxzKmrZp6lmrm0ecemqmacop7Dpr7SZpmlmZ6ZerGx0aymp5mcnsG6ecWiqZ5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brendan-fraser-admits-returning-for-the-mummy-4-sounds-like-fun.html><span>←</span><span>Brendan Fraser admits returning for The Mummy 4 sounds like fun</span></a>

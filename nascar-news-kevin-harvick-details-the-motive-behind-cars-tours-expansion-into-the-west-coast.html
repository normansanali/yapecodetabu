A consortium consisting of NASCAR Hall of Famer<strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dale Earnhardt Jr</a></strong>., 2014 NASCAR Cup champion <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Harvick</a></strong>, ex-multiple-time Cup race winner <strong>Jeff Burton</strong>, and Trackhouse Racing co-owner <strong>Justin Marks</strong>, where racers were the aspirants.</p><p>They took over the regional Asphalt Racing series CARS Tours as part of the project and had a successful season in 2023 under their management. Going into 2024, they have bigger plans and recently announced an expansion of the series. They will go across the country to the West Coast with this.</p><p>This year’s championship will feature a race at Kevin Harvick’s Kern Raceway on March 2nd. This track was renamed in honor of the SHR legend towards the end of this year after the new owner’s group took over the track. While talking about the extension, Kevin Harvick pointed out that adding the track to the schedule is special because it is his home.</p><pre class=wp-block-verse>The West Coast is home for me, and the tracks we’ll be going to this year with the zMAX CARS Tour Pro Late Model Series West are some of the ones that helped shape the path of my career. I was fortunate enough to have people help me along the way to make it to the top level of NASCAR, and that is what we want to do with the CARS Tour.</pre>Harvick said <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">via a statement</a>.<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-move-aligns-with-the-cars-tours-main-objective>The move aligns with the CARS Tours’ main objective</h2><p>Alongside giving back to the racing community, this CRARS Tour initiative will help build the series while giving attention to the next generation of drivers at the top level, as the series hopes for. This is the step in the right direction for everyone involved in the series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Dale-Eranhardt-Jr-Kevin-Harvick-1.jpg><p>We want to continue to build the series, bring attention to the drivers and the local tracks, and help usher the next generation of drivers to the top levels of racing. Adding this West Coast schedule for 2024 is the next step to making that happen.</p><p>This is also a big win for <strong>Tim Huddleston</strong>, who recently took over the track as part of the new management. The respect he showed towards Harvick with the re-naming of the track might have played a role In the CARS Tour coming to the West Coast.</p><p>Discover:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57zZqqnJmiYrumw9Jmop6umaN6qa3Rr6Cco12ZsrWtyKWqZqyYmnquu9OirZ5lkpq1qrrDZpqaqqNiwbDB0axknrCglru0tc6nZKKmpKR6tbTEZq6eq6RisLCt0q1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jesse-hart-wife-family-prize-money-net-worth-512637-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jesse Hart: Wife, Family, Prize Money &amp;amp; Net Worth</span></a>

His influence on the team reaches beyond the court.</p><h2><strong>When is Jett Howard returning To The Court?</strong></h2><p>Jett Howard will be eager to return to the court for the Wolverines whenever he is given the all-clear.&nbsp;</p><p>Although, one must assume that coach Juwan Howard will be cautious with the freshman and won’t stress him too much.</p><p>It is up to Howard and the medical team to decide when the six-foot guard is ready to return to complete playing duties.</p><h2><strong>Jett Howard&nbsp; Parents And Age</strong></h2><p>Born on September 14, 2003, in Chicago, Illinois, Jett Howard is 19 years old as of 2023.

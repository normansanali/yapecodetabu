Rob, Adele's former friend from rehab, actually projected his spirit into the body of Adele and killed her, meaning he lived on in her body. <strong>In present day, we see Rob in Adele's body pull the same stunt on Louise – all to get closer to David.</strong></p><p id=eEKZMPUx5B3E data-wc=48>The show then ends by seeing 'Louise', David and Adam driving off into the sunset, but Adam sense something is up. Series two would no doubt continue the story, giving viewers an update on their life and documenting&nbsp;whether David or Adam confront Louise for her odd behaviour.</p><p id=eaVylW4z89iz data-wc=41>If more episodes do happen, viewers can also expect to see the cast return, including Tom Bateman as David, Simona Brown as Louise and Eve Hewson as Adele.

The land surrounding the farm colony seems to have developed a horrific history early on. (The serial-killing Cropsey included.) The macabre story started back in the 1920’s, when a young boy went missing the same day he was seen with an elderly man in the woods around Sea View. Then famously, throughout the 1970’s and 80’s several children from Staten Island went missing; all of them presumed dead, though only one body was ever found – that of Jennifer Schweiger, a 12-year-old girl with Downs Syndrome, buried in a shallow grave in the woods surrounding the colony."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

He hasn’t yet been proven guilty of murder, but was convicted on two counts of kidnapping, and is currently serving 50 years to life in prison. In 1972, a young filmmaker named Geraldo Rivera made a documentary bringing to light the horrific conditions within the institution that Rand worked, exposing how the disabled children were mistreated and forced to live in filth.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-17429 alt="Graffiti Interior" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FarmColonyInteriorGrafitti.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-17429 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Flickr</a></p><p>Since the landmark designation was implemented, the remaining buildings of Sea View and Willowbrook have fallen into various states of disrepair, crumbling into a ghost town. The aura of eeriness permeates. Graffiti has spread over the interior and exterior of the buildings like a sickness. People continue to visit the grounds, amid rumors concerning séances and devil worship within the compound and surrounding forest. The homeless continue to seek shelter there, and in the underground tunnels of Willowbrook that still remain. To say that this whole New York forest is occupied by ghosts is an understatement, as it is haunted by real memories of the gross mistreatment of actual patients, mostly children.</p><p>The documentary film “Cropsey”, produced by filmmakers Joshua Zeman and Barbara Brancaccio in 2009, focuses on the legend, kidnappings and murders that took place in Staten Island in the 1970’s and 80’s. A trailer for that documentary can be seen below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyvsdZmsKiqm2KwqsDYZp2aqp1isLC4zqewaGo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./family-photographers-el-paso.html><span>←</span><span>The 12 Best Family Photographers in El Paso</span></a>

Australia’s increasing nuclearisation will not change New Zealand’s longstanding ban on nuclear-propelled vessels entering New Zealand’s waters, according to both Labour and National.
The New Zealand Government has also reminded Australia of a 1980s treaty the country signed that established a nuclear weapons-free zone in the South Pacific.
Under the Aukus agreement between the US, Australia, and the UK, Australia will take delivery of at least three, potentially second-hand, Virginia-class submarines early next decade - although this would need to be approved by the US Congress."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Australian media have reported several calls were made by Australia to friends and allies ahead of the announcement.</p><p>When asked about New Zealand joining the Aukus agreement in some non-nuclear capacity, perhaps relating to the development of artificial intelligence or cybersecurity tools, Mahuta appeared open-minded, but cited the Treaty of Rarotonga - a 1985 agreement establishing a nuclear weapons-free zone in the South Pacific and banning the use, testing, and possession of nuclear weapons within the zone.</p><p>Australia also signed the agreement.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“New Zealand has been really clear that in relation to those arrangements that the Treaty of Rarotonga is something that is very important to us in terms of the views of the Pacific,” Mahuta said.</p><p>“We assert our interests based on our independent foreign policy and what is good for the Pacific region.</p><p>“We have kept open future discussion around issues such as cybersecurity.”</p><p>As well as being Foreign Affairs Minister, Mahuta is also the Minister for Nuclear Disarmament.</p><p>Mahuta said that when New Zealand was briefed on the arrangement, the Government reminded Australia of the Pacific nuclear weapons-free zone.</p><p>“We made very clear that the Treaty of Rarotonga is an important consideration for our region.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“We have asserted that we want the Treaty of Rarotonga upheld because it is important for the Pacific and that assurance has been given by Australia.”</p><p>Some in Australia are currently discussing whether American nuclear weapons have a place in Australia, potentially as part of a defensive hedge against China.</p><p>Australia’s international treaty arrangements prohibit Australia from permanently housing nuclear weapons on its soil, but Australia’s most senior defence public servant indicated last month that American planes rotating through Australia could carry nuclear warheads without breaching the treaty.</p><p>The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the public would never be informed whether such aircraft are carrying nuclear weapons under the US’s policy of neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear warheads on its vessels.</p><p>Department of Defence Secretary Greg Moriarty told Senate estimates hearings that the “stationing of nuclear weapons in Australia is prohibited by the South Pacific Nuclear-free Zone Treaty to which Australia is fully committed”.</p><p>But he also said there was “no impediment under this treaty or the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty to the visit of foreign aircraft to Australian airfields or transit of Australia’s airspace, including in the context of our training and exercise programs and Australia’s force posture co-operation program with the United States.”</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The US is preparing to build dedicated facilities for up to six B-52 bombers at Tindal air base, south of Darwin.

According to Hesperia Unified School District Superintendent David Olney:</p>“We are still gathering information and cooperating fully with law enforcement. We will continue to keep student safety and well-being as our top priority.”<p>On Tuesday, cops identified the suspect as John Ryan, 42, and took him into custody from the 15400 Block of Nisqualli Road in Victorville. The same has been confirmed by Bernardino County Sheriff’s officials. The suspect further faces charges related to accessing child p*rnography.

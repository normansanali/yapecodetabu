Sure, he headlined Constantine back in 2005, but that was only a modest hit. Though it did go on to develop a cult following in the years since and there’ve been rumors of a sequel doing the rounds recently.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Michelle Obama shows off toned legs in Mallorca</h2><time>Aug 31, 2024</time>

Australia’s increasing nuclearisation will not change New Zealand’s longstanding ban on nuclear-propelled vessels entering New Zealand’s waters, according to both Labour and National.
The New Zealand Government has also reminded Australia of a 1980s treaty the country signed that established a nuclear weapons-free zone in the South Pacific.
Under the Aukus agreement between the US, Australia, and the UK, Australia will take delivery of at least three, potentially second-hand, Virginia-class submarines early next decade - although this would need to be approved by the US Congress.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Patton Oswalt Paints Hilarious Portraits of Weirdness</h2><time>Aug 31, 2024</time>

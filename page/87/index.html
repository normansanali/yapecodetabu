‚ÄúMe so Christmas, me so merry.‚Äù
‚ÄúRegional Holiday Music‚Äù wasn‚Äôt the last episode of Community, but a part wouldn‚Äôt be too sad ‚Äî more sad? ‚Äî if it had been. There‚Äôs been a lot of build up for it this past week by people like me, because not only was it the final episode for a few months (probably), and not only was it a Christmas episode, meaning it had to contend with ‚ÄúAbed‚Äôs Uncontrollable Christmas,‚Äù it was also a Glee-parodying musical.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Do turtles dig holes in your yard?</h2><time>Aug 18, 2024</time>

In the event that anything does not appeal to them, they will continue looking, even if they have already dug a large hole.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Donald Trump height, weight and body measurements</h2><time>Aug 18, 2024</time>

Rarely has a movie received publicity as bizarre and messy as Olivia Wilde's sophomore feature, Don't Worry Darling. Wilde's second project ‚Äî a stylish, if half-baked and ultra-derivative, feminist thriller that shies away from its most interesting, most uncomfortable questions ‚Äî would be a rather forgettable one, despite Florence Pugh's strong central performance.

Actors of Laurence Olivier and Marlon Brando‚Äôs caliber are always considered classic; they were theatrically-trained professionals who took everything seriously, and produced some of the best performances that we can think of. But there can be a double-edged sword to this kind of performer ‚Äî Brando was such an industry professional that he took himself over-seriously in his later years, and created a lot of behind-the-scenes drama. He may have crafted some of cinema‚Äôs ultimate roles as Stanley Kowalski and Don Corleone, but his ego seemed to overshadow his work.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Mick Jenkins</h2><time>Aug 18, 2024</time>

<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Pete Wentz Talks About Delivering Son Saint Lazslo, Explains Name</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong><a href=#>Pete Wentz</a></strong> is a very hands-on dad. In fact, he helped deliver son <strong>Saint Lazslo</strong> when girlfriend <strong>Meagan Camper</strong> gave birth on Wednesday, Aug. 20. Speaking about the experience during a Sept. 11 interview for <strong><a href=#>Ryan Seacrest</a></strong>'s KIIS FM show On Air With Ryan Seacrest, the Fall Out Boy rocker said it was a "beautiful" — but scary — thing.</p><p>"It was crazy. The doctor was like, 'You're going to help, you're going to deliver this baby,'" Wentz, 35, recalled. "And I was like, 'Oh my god, I'm not ready.'"</p><p>Nevertheless, the father of two — he also has a 5-year-old son, <strong>Bronx</strong>, with ex-wife <strong><a href=#>Ashlee Simpson</a></strong> — stepped up. "I put on the scrubs and gloves and stuff and did the delivery," he told Seacrest. "After the head came out, I was there, you know, and all I could think was, 'Please do not drop this baby.'" He added, "Newborn babies are super slippery."</p><p>Ultimately, he handled the situation — and his son — just fine. "I was sure that I wasn't gonna be able to handle it. And everyone says when it's your kid, you can, and it's different. And really, that is true," Wentz shared. "Because when I was down there, it was like this amazing, beautiful thing."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The proud second-time dad also explained the origin of his little one's name. He and Camper had been considering various options but decided on "Saint" because the baby waited until Wentz's tour was over to make his big debut.</p><p>"I was really sure we were going to have to cancel a show, or that he was going to show up, and he didn't," the musician said. "That's why Saint ended up happening, which will only be a problem, I feel, if he actually became a saint. That would be really weird."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapnaSaerixza2xZqyRobi0ecCbpq6sXZmyrbXVnqmippdiwLC6jKyYoqakYrmixtKlpmadqKW5orXNrGSnmZ2aenN8kG1obnFf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ncaa-jett-howard-got-jnjured-parents-and-age.html><span>←</span><span>NCAA: Jett Howard Got Injured?

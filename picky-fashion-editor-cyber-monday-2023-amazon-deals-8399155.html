We all have our tastes and preferences in things, and I am more difficult to win over (just ask my now fiancé). That said, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>when I do like something</a>, you can rest assured that it’s really special. While I don’t have a “check list” of things to tick off, there are select requirements I subconsciously look for to set the good apart from the amazing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, it should come as no wonder that I’ve become a sort-of guru among my friends and family in finding <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the best of the best in the shopping world</a> (which just so happens to be my job). I’ve tried the best and the not so good, so I know what to look for, which is why my loved ones <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">trust my recommendation</a>. Though they will say I’m picky when it comes to what I add to my wardrobe, I call it shopping smart. Knowing what’s worth it has saved me so much stress in terms of space (I have a small NYC closet!) and returns, which we all know can be a hassle.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, while I’m not doing a lot of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shopping this Cyber Monday</a>, I’m particularly fond of these five deals I found on Amazon. And if they made it into my cart, they should absolutely make it into yours.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mangopop-mock-turtleneck-long-sleeve-bodysuit></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Mangopop Mock Turtleneck Long-Sleeve Bodysuit</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I’ve been seeing <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">this turtleneck</a> pop up everywhere, and naturally, I’m intrigued. Plus, this time of year is also when the staple is most used — it’s a layering must-have that works under sweaters, jackets, and slip dresses. So, of course, I need it. It’s made from what looks to be a super flattering modal-spandex blend, plus it has more than 33,000 five-star ratings (!!!) — that’s certainly not nothing. Shoppers call it “<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">soft, stretchy, flattering</a>,” and “buttery soft” and honestly, those are the key qualities I look for in <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a really good bodysuit</a>. It’s also 54 percent off, so like, how can I resist?</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Shop more Cyber Monday deals on bodysuits:</span></h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-levis-ribcage-straight-ankle-jeans></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Levi's Ribcage Straight Ankle Jeans</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I’m a sucker for Levi’s jeans, just like Jennifer Aniston, so whenever the brand’s styles go on sale, I scour through to find the best available. Arguably <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the Ribcage style</a> is the best and most popular of all. The classic straight-leg cut will never go out of style, plus they’re crafted from a rigid cotton with just the right amount of stretch that they’re flattering while still being comfy but don’t risk being stretched out with too much wear. All the Levi’s I own have gone through multiple wash cycles and wears, and they still look just like they did when I first bought them.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Shop more Cyber Monday deals on jeans:&nbsp;</span></h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-fp-movement-ottoman-slouchy-sweater></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>FP Movement Ottoman Slouchy Sweater</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My mom, sister, and I all own <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">this slouchy Free People sweater</a>; it’s funny, every time we FaceTime each other, more likely than not, we’re twinning in it. “Are you wearing… that sweater?” I ask. “Yes,” we all say laughing. This scenario should already tell you all you need to know about this oversized knit: It’s so good that you’ll be living in it 24/7, and that’s exactly why I’m stocking up while it’s marked down to $92. It truly has the ideal nonchalant slouchy silhouette that looks so cool with jeans, trousers, or even silk midi skirts.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Shop more Cyber Monday deals on sweaters:</span></h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-madewell-the-mini-sydney-cutout-tote-in-leather></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Madewell the Mini Sydney Cutout Tote in Leather</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">A leather purse for $51</a>? Talk about a steal. I had to do a double take, because I definitely thought this Madewell tote deal was a mistake. But alas, it’s a dream come true, and I can’t wait for mine to arrive. The small silhouette makes it ideal for anyone who tends to pack too much in their purse (me!), while the two-way wearing — aka, with a crossbody strap or without — gives it some variety. Of course, the supple leather material looks so luxe, people are going to think you spent at least three times its actual price.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Shop more Cyber Monday deals on handbags:&nbsp;</span></h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-vince-hilda-ankle-booties></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Vince Hilda Ankle Booties</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These are a splurge, but anything from Vince is worth it, as the brand is known for its well-made, timeless staple pieces that last forever. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Simple black boots like this pair</a>? A no-brainer. They have a humble heel, giving you a little bit of height without being impractical, plus a functional side zipper for easy on, easy off.

When it comes to designing an architecture around a power envelope the rule of thumb is any given microprocessor architecture can scale to target an order of magnitude of TDPs. For example, Intel’s Core architectures (Sandy/Ivy Bridge) effectively target the 13W - 130W range. They can surely be used in parts that consume less or more power, but at those extremes it’s more efficient to build another microarchitecture to target those TDPs instead.</description></item><item><title>The Penguin Colonel-in-Chief Of The Norwegian King's Guard</title><link>/nils-olav-penguin-king-guard.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/nils-olav-penguin-king-guard.html</guid><description>RZSS/Katie Paton Sir Nils Olav the Penguin inspects the King's Guard of Norway after being bestowed with a knighthood at Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland in 2008.Wikimedia Commons RZSS/Katie Paton RZSS/Katie Paton ED Jones/AFP/Getty Images ED Jones/AFP/Getty Images Wikimedia Commons A bronze statue of Sir Nils Olav.Wikimedia Commons ED Jones/AFP/Getty Images ED Jones/AFP/Getty Images Wikimedia Commons ED Jones/AFP/Getty Images Like this gallery?

バンドではコーラスやエフェクターの操作を巧みに操り、
セカオワの音を作る上で欠かせない存在となってます。
ピエロのようなマスクをつけているということで、
子供によってはDJ LOVEさんを怖がったりしますが、
実際にはバンドで一番、温厚な性格だとされてます。
しかし、DJ LOVEの素顔って気になりますよね？
果たしてどんな人が中にいるのか・・・笑。
DJ LOVEの素顔(画像)と誕生日と本名 これまでセカオワのDJ LOVEさんの素顔は、
謎とされ続け、この先も公表されることはないと思われていまいた。
しかし、さくらだ（元あやまんじゃぱん）さんのツイッターの投稿の中に、
DJ LOVEさんの素顔らしき人物が登場していたのです！
その投稿ではさくらださんはさおりさんの誕生日会に参加したそうで、
そこに同級生がたくさんいたと興奮されてました。
投稿の写真の中にはセカオワメンバーがずらりと並び、
同級生というのは深瀬さんとさおりさんとなかじんさんでした。
写ってるもう一人の男の人は誰？というところから、
素顔のDJ LOVEさんではないか？と憶測されたのです。
これでDJ LOVEさんだけいなかったらだたの省きになりますから・・・笑
ちなみにDJ LOVEの素顔とされるのは、深瀬さんの隣の黒のタンクトップの方。少しぽちゃっとした体型的にも、疑われても仕方ない感じですね。仮に本当だとしたら、かなりレアな写真ですね。
しかし、この写真に写ってる男性は深瀬さんの先輩だとかで、否定されてました。
ダンプ松本さんに似ているということですが、
当初は深瀬さんがかぶる予定だったものの、
さおりさんが「かわいい顔してる」とストップをかけ、
現在の方がマスクを被ってるという形です。
DJ LOVEの本名は未だに非公開ですが、
この先、公表される可能性は十分にありそうです。
生年月日は１９８５年８月２３日と公表されているので、
隠すのが辛くなってきた時期に、あっさり本名まで出るのかな？と。
DJ LOVEのぬいぐるみ(お面・マスク)の販売店舗と取り方。太った？ バンドのマスコット的な存在であるDJ LOVEさんですが、
その姿はライブのグッズになどに活用されているそうです。
また、ぬいぐるみまでもが販売されており、
アマゾンなどで買うことが可能です。
今年の１月からの期間限定キャンペーンでは、
タイトーのツイッターアカウントをフォローし、
指定されたハッシュタグと共に投稿すると、
DJ LOVEのサインが１０名に当たるというものがありました。
基本的にはクレーンゲームにも登場してるようで、
ファンの方は気合で入手したことでしょう。
ちなみにセカオワ公式ではないものの、
DJ LOVEのマスクのみもアマゾンなど販売されており、
ハロウィーンシーズンなどには人気商品になっています。
しかし、最近になってDJ LOVEさん太ったのも、
もしかしたら、今のマスクは小さくなってるかも？笑
今後、DJ LOVEさんがダイエットしなければ、
一回り大きいマスクに変更される可能性があるので、
またのデザインアップに期待できますね！</description></item><item><title>Alison Mosshart Bio (Wiki)</title><link>/alison-mosshart-biography.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/alison-mosshart-biography.html</guid><description>Who is&amp;nbsp;Alison Mosshart?Alison Mosshart is one of the popular American singers, songwriters, and an artist he is also popular as the lead vocalist for the rock band The Kills.Likewise, she is also the lead vocalist of the band like the blues-rock band The Dead Weather.

Picky might have a negative ring to it, but I like to think of it as having standards. We all have our tastes and preferences in things, and I am more difficult to win over (just ask my now fiancé). That said, when I do like something, you can rest assured that it’s really special. While I don’t have a “check list” of things to tick off, there are select requirements I subconsciously look for to set the good apart from the amazing.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jocelyn Maminta WTNH/News 8, Biography, Age, Education, Husband, Children, Height, Carolines Room</h2><time>Sep 26, 2024</time>

Most AI discourse takes a distinctly utopian or dystopian view of the future.

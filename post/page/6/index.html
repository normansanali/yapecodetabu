Kate Upton gave a glimpse into a special mother-daughter moment breast-feeding her 14-month-old, Genevieve.
“Every woman needs to give their body time to heal and to soak in those early, precious moments,” the model, 27, tweeted of motherhood on Wednesday, January 22. “I realized quickly that between breast-feeding, healing, little-to-no sleep, off-the-charts hormone changes and experiencing everything for the first time, weight-loss pressures are extremely unnecessary, and I decided to turn my energy towards my family.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Kathryn Dennis' New Man Chleb Ravenell: 5 Things to Know</h2><time>Sep 29, 2024</time>

They say what comes around goes around — and even though that reference isn't specifically in reference to&nbsp;Kylie Jenner's changing hairstyles, it's definitely appropriate. Today, the mom and mogul shared a carousel of snapshots on Instagram that showed her with pink hair again after the reality star dabbled in the quiet luxury trend last year and had her hair in a more natural dark chocolate shade. Of course, Jenner has had just about every single hair color under the planet, but the shift back to pink is something fans are calling a throwback to the days of King Kylie.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Microsoft Introduces A 128GB Version Of The Core i7 Surface Pro 3</h2><time>Sep 29, 2024</time>

As reported yesterday on the site, at the "Extreme Rising" event this past weekend in Philly. The following details were given to me during a phone conversation with New Jack late Sunday night.

Mahoney had taken a "ring rat" (term used for a girl or woman frequenting a wrestling event in attempt to sleep with the crew or wrestlers) back to the hotel after the matches and "</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Guard Da Fatboy &amp;quot;Icon&amp;quot; Long Sleeve Tee</h2><time>Aug 15, 2024</time>

The singer may not be releasing all that much new music these days but she's still finding ways to keep us interested. Jhené tied her hair up in a bun and showed off her back tattoo, which ends up connecting to the massive cover-up on her arm. "Her name is Chilombo," said the artist of the creature on her back. "Half dragon, half phoenix... and she's a fucking beast..."
Chilombo is Jhené's family name so the dragon-phoenix&nbsp;hybrid on her skin might be representative of the beast inside of her soul.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Kelly Ripa Shares How She Deals with Mark Consuelos' Stripper Past</h2><time>Aug 15, 2024</time>

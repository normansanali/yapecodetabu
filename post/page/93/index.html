Comparisons to those Android phones will also have to wait until their respective reviews, and for now I can only really compare the iPhone SE to Apple's other iPhones along with 2015's flagship Android devices.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The full cast of XO, Kitty</h2><time>Aug 15, 2024</time>

A supplier of PCs from China has added support for Intel‚Äôs Coffee Lake CPUs to its platforms based on Intel‚Äôs H110 chipset. The announcement does not mean that mainboards from other brands can work with Intel‚Äôs latest CPUs, but certainly raises questions.

Both CPUs belong to the Coffee Lake family, which uses a different power delivery method than processors which belong to the Skylake and Kaby Lake families (please check our Coffee Lake review for details).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>RTX 2070 vs. GTX 1080: Should You Upgrade?</h2><time>Aug 14, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../the-49ers-defense-was-too-much-to-handle-for-the-cowboys-in-their-19-12-win-to-advance-to-the-nfc-championship.html></a>
The Divisional Round of the 2023 NFL Playoffs ended with arguably the closest game of the weekend as the San Francisco 49ers defeated the Dallas Cowboys in a tight 19-12 win.
The 49ers defense was able to cause multiple turnovers that would result in a win and a trip to Philadelphia to take on the Eagles in the NFC Championship Game.
Before covering the Niners, much credit and praise should be given to Dan Quinn and the Cowboys defense, as they did all they could to give their offense an opportunity multiple times throughout the contest.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/93/>‚Üê Prev Page</a>

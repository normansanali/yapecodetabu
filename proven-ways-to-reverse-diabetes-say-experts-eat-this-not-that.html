To really lose weight, aim for 300 minutes of aerobic exercise per week. Low-intensity activities, such as walking, biking, swimming or jogging, can lead to great results.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/08/fruits-and-vegetables-with-chlorpyrifos.jpg><p><span>“Eat a well-balanced diet,” </span><span>says Trinh Le, MPH, RD.</span><span> “Eat a diet high in whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and lean protein with calories set for gradual weight loss (e.g. about 1-2 pounds per week). Cut way back on added sugars and alcohol since these nutrients will more likely end up as visceral fat.”</span><span aria-hidden=true>6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/01/My-project-94.jpg><p><span>“If your goal is to lose fat, skipping sleep is like poking sticks in your bicycle wheels,” </span><span>says Plamen Penev, MD, Ph.D.</span><span>, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago. “Cutting back on sleep, a behavior that is ubiquitous in modern society, appears to compromise efforts to lose fat through dieting. In our study it reduced fat loss by 55 percent.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/01/My-project-14-1.jpg><p><span>“Because aging is associated with sarcopenia, the loss of skeletal muscle mass, relying on body weight alone is insufficient for the study of healthy aging,” </span><span>says Rania Mekary</span><span>, a researcher in HSPH’s Department of Nutrition and assistant professor of social and administrative sciences at the School of Pharmacy of MCPHS University. “Measuring waist circumference is a better indicator of healthy body composition among older adults. Engaging in resistance training or, ideally, combining it with aerobic exercise could help older adults lessen abdominal fat while increasing or preserving muscle mass.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/02/woman-bath-relax.jpg><p><span>“Reduce your stress. When we’re stressed, our adrenal glands produce cortisol, a stress hormone,” says Dr. Chen. “Cortisol stimulates our fight or flight response, which in turn stimulates our appetite to fuel our bodies to combat the stress. This leads to higher insulin levels in our bodies and a craving for sugary, fatty foods.” And to live your healthiest life, don’t miss this life-saving advice <b>I’m a Doctor and Here’s the #1 Sign You Have Cancer</b>.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82uq6uhpJ68r3vPq6avnZ5ixKLF0marqGWimsOmvtKeZJ2hkZeytbHSZqqasV2axbGx0a2qZp2RqXq1tMisZKenpGLBqa3TaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./prince-andrew-being-offered-frogmore-offended-prince-harry-meghan.html><span>←</span><span>Prince Andrew Being Offered Frogmore Offended Prince Harry, Meghan</span></a>

The couple reportedly married in 1996. Authorities stated in a bail letter in the case that hairs believed to match Asa’s were discovered on some of the victims’ bodies.</p><p>On July 28, 2015, she updated her Facebook profile picture with a photo of herself with Rex in the background.</p><p>Since Asa was out of the state, they think the hairs came from the couple’s residence or were transferred from Rex’s clothing, according to the letter, which Daily Mail has published in its entirety. Asa who is the second wife of Rex, has not been charged with any involvement in the crimes.</p><p>On July 14, 2023, Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney announced at a press conference that Rex had been placed under custody. Between July 2007 and September 2010, these young ladies were reported missing. In September 2010, they were discovered, Tierney said. According to him, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello, and Megan Waterman’s killings were committed by Rex. According to Tierney, the murder of Maureen Brainard-Barnes is still being looked into.</p><p>Suffolk County District Attorney said that during the murders of the last three women, Asa, and his children were out of New York state, and he was alone in the tri-state area. A significant hair was recovered on Amber’s body, Ray said. The hairs could not be tested for years until DNA technology improved because they had degraded, he said.</p><p>The “ramshackle Long Island home he grew up in” where Rex lived with his family and had two previous marriages, according to The New York Post, is where he currently resides. According to NBC News, Rex, and his wife were referred to as loners who kept to themselves, and their home was considered “creepy” in the area.</p><p>Asa and Rex also reportedly had financial troubles. The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance revealed that Heuermann and his wife, Asa Ellerup, also owe a total of more than $81,500 in personal income tax to the state. Other sources revealed that the couple reportedly owns a condo together in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><p>Before marrying Asa, Rex married Elizabeth R. Ryan of North Brunswick who worked as a junior planner for an office product company.</p><p>In 2023, Rex Heuermann is 59 years of age. He is an accomplished architectural consultant who considers himself to be an authority on the complexities of New York City’s building code. His precise instructions impressed some clients while driving others insane. He worked at a building not far from the Empire State.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">American Airlines, Catholic Charities, and the city’s Department of Environmental Protection were among Rex’s clients, according to his resume and the website of his business, RH Consultants & Associates. He frequently appeared on behalf of clients before the Landmark Preservation Commission and took credit for hundreds of applications that were approved by city agencies.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Rex spent roughly 30 years working with Steve Kramberg, a property manager in Brooklyn, who described him as “a gem to deal with, highly knowledgeable.” Rex was “a big goofy guy, a little bit on the nerdy side” who worked long hours and was available day and night, Steve said. But he was also devoted to his wife, who Mr. Kramberg said had health problems, and to his elderly mother.</p><h3><strong>Asa Ellerup And Rex Heuermann Children</strong></h3><p>Asa Ellerup and Rex Heuermann are parents to two children. While one child is reportedly of special needs, their daughter Victoria worked for his architectural firm in New York City until the web page was scrubbed after his arrest.</p><p>Their child with special needs is from Asa’s previous marriage. After Rex and Asa’s marriage, Rex became stepfather to Asa’s son.</p><p>The married couple then welcomed Victoria in the same year. She was born in 1996 and is 27 years of age.</p><p>Per LinkedIn, which likely belonged to Victoria, she worked as a sales associate at Macy’s from 2017 to 2019. She attended the New York Institute of Technology. Her bio reads, “I am a recent graduate of the New York Institute of Technology with a BFA in Fine Arts. I know 3D/2D Animation, Modeling, Sculpting, Autodesk Maya/Mudbox, ZBrush, ToonBoom Harmony, Photoshop, Illustrator, and editing in After Effects and Premier.

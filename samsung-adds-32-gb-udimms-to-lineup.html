The UDIMMs are based on the company’s 16 Gb chips, which were introduced earlier this year that are already used for 32 GB SO-DIMMs as well as 64 GB RDIMMs.</p><p><a href=#>Samsung’s 32 GB UDIMM</a> is rated to operate at DDR4-2666 date rates at the DDR4 standard voltage of 1.2 V. Samsung does not disclose timings, but since the company sells its own memory modules mainly to large PC OEMs, it is highly likely that the 32 GB UDIMM uses the standard JEDEC latencies for DDR4-2666 (i.e., CL17 17-17 or higher).</p><p>32 GB UDIMMs will enable system integrators and PC enthusiasts to build PCs with 128 GB of memory using motherboards with four DDR4 slots. Now it's worth noting that current mainstream CPUs and motherboards are only validated for 64 GB of memory, but eventually we'll either see current platforms validated for the larger DIMMs, or the next generation of platforms will support them from the start.</p><p>Samsung’s 16 Gb DDR4 memory chips are made using the company’s 10 nm-class process technology and, according to the company, modules that use these DRAMs are more energy efficient than DIMMs of the same capacity that rely on a larger number of 8 Gb devices.</p><p>Since Samsung already lists its 32 GB unbuffered DIMMs featuring the 16 Gb memory chips, it is highly likely that these modules are already available to at least some of its customers. Pricing of the modules is unknown, but a 32 GB DIMM costs around $300 these days.</p><p>Note: Image is for illustrative purposes only.</p><p>Related Reading:</p><p>Source: <a href=#>Samsung</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH50f5FsZqyZnajCr7OMmpudq11of26zwWasnaGdosBuwM5mo6Kmlaq9</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicole-flenory-net-worth-age-wiki-biography-relationship-wife-dating-ethnicity-height-facts-html.html><span>←</span><span>Nicole Flenory Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Biography, Relationship, Wife, Dating, Ethnicity,Height&amp;amp;</span></a>

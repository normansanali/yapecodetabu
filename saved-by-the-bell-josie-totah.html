On the show, she plays Lexi, a fashion-loving cheerleader.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC / Peacock</span></figure><p>The revamped version of <a href=#>Saved by the Bell</a> brings up new questions about issues like systematic inequality or racism, with a daring attitude the original high school comedy series was, arguably, low on.&nbsp;</p><p>Featuring new faces like <a href=#>Josie Totah</a>, Mitchell Hoog, and Haskiri Velazquez, and returning cast members like Elizabeth Berkley and Mario Lopez, the reboot takes a fresh look at what everyday life is like at Bayside High.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Josie Totah plays Lexi, a trans cheerleader on 'Saved by the Bell.'</h2><p>On <a href=#>Saved by the Bell,</a> Josie plays Lexi, a mightily popular and all the more powerful cheerleader with a strong sense of style and an even sharper tongue to match. A member of the in-crowd, Lexi is often spotted alongside Mac (Mitchell Hoog), the Governor of California and Bayside alum, Zack Morris (Mark-Paul Gosselaar)'s son.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC / Peacock</span></figure><p>Josie came out publicly via an essay published by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Time Magazine</a> in August 2018, having already built an impressive portfolio as an actress. Following her first breakthrough with a 2012 short film, titled Hip Kids, she went on to appear on TV series like Glee, Jessie, and Champions.&nbsp;</p><p>As she explained in the essay, she first learned about hormone replacement therapy at age 14, while watching a docuseries titled I Am Jazz with her mother. She immediately knew that she wanted to do the same thing, and with her mother's help, she had her first medical appointment within days.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC / Peacock</span></figure><p>As Josie revealed in the essay, not every part of the transition was easy. For a while, she struggled with severe anxiety and self-doubt. &nbsp;</p><p>"Like many trans people, I developed serious anxiety as I hid who I was. In some ways, I felt like I was lying by letting people believe I was that gay boy. I also couldn’t be myself," she wrote.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">As a producer of 'Saved by the Bell,' Josie had more of a say in her character's narrative arc.</h2><p>The difficulties that Josie faced are pushed to the background of Saved by the Bell, one of the few shows that don't treat being transgender as a definitive trait of one's identity.&nbsp;</p><p>"Getting to play a role that’s dynamic and interesting and more than what people think about on the outside is such a gift as an actor," Josie told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teen Vogue</a>.</p><p>"[Lexi is] this mean, fun, aspirational, fantastical character that also happens to be transgender — but it [isn't] everything about her. That was really important to me and the people that I talked to in the trans community because so much of the trans representation in [media] has to do with struggle ..." she added.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC / Peacock</span></figure><p>" ... and that's only when it's done in favor of trans people, [most] of the time [the media] perpetuates the negative stigmas and stereotypes that create the erasure of trans people in our world," she went on to say.&nbsp;</p><p>As a producer, Josie had a say in her character's narrative arc. Working in close collaboration with showrunner Tracey Wigfield, she hoped to create a cheerleader who relishes in drama and is gifted with the ability to coin some snappy comebacks.&nbsp;</p><p>Saved by the Bell is available on&nbsp;Peacock now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqK63scNmmbJlpJ2ybq7EpaNmop%2BotqZ506irmqA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-lawrence-i-had-a-copious-amount-of-butt-plugs-found-by-hotel-maid-20131912.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Lawrence Sex Toys: Maid Found &amp;quot;Copious Amount of Butt Plugs&amp;quot;</span></a>

In the “Puntería” visual, Laviscount plays a centaur with <a href=# rel=noopener>toned abs and horse hoofs</a>. After Shakira wounds him with an arrow, she sensually tends to his injuries. Once he’s healed, Laviscount gets cozy with Shakira, kissing her shoulder and nearly touching lips.</p><p>Days after the video was released, Shakira was spotted out in New York City with the actor on March 26.</p><p>The singer’s budding romance with Laviscount comes after a “rough year” following her split from <strong>Gerard Piqué</strong>, the second source says. “But she’s moved on and is feeling better than ever,” the insider adds.</p><p>Shakira and Piqué, 37, were <a href=#>together for 11 years</a> before <a href=#>they broke up in June 2022</a>. Their split made headlines after reports surfaced that the former soccer player was unfaithful, allegedly cheating on Shakira with now-girlfriend <strong>Clara Chia Marti</strong>.</p><p>“It’s been tough not only for me, but also for my kids,” Shakira told <a href=#>Elle</a> in September 2022, referring to her and Piqué’s two sons, <a href=#>Milan, 11, and Sasha, 9</a>. “Incredibly difficult. … I’ve tried to conceal the situation in front of my kids. I try to do it and to protect them, because that’s my number one mission in life.”</p><p>She described the past few months as the “darkest hour of my life” as the split came amid her father’s ailing health and a tax evasion investigation.</p><p>Shakira was accused in 2018 of defrauding the Spanish government of more than $15 million in taxes from 2012 to 2014. The prosecutor announced in July 2022 that the government was seeking a prison term of eight years and a fine of €23 million if Shakira was found guilty.</p><p>While her rep has denied the tax agency’s claims in 2022, Shakira <a href=#>reached a settlement in November 2023</a> to avoid jail time. She had to acknowledge her six counts of tax fraud and pay a fine of €7 million ($7.6 million), according to AP.</p><p>Shakira has since begun focusing on <a href=#>releasing new music</a> and <a href=#>raising her two sons</a>. She has also started to dip her toe back in the dating pool.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After a short romance with NBA player <strong>Jimmy Butler</strong> in summer 2023, <a href=#>a source exclusively told Us </a>in September 2023, “Shakira has a lot on her plate. … But she’s definitely optimistic about finding love again.”</p><p>Ahead of her connection with Laviscount, an insider <a href=#>exclusively told Us</a> in March that Shakira “isn’t ready for a relationship,” but the Grammy winner is “very open to some casual dating.”</p><p>Watch the exclusive video above for more details on Laviscount’s budding romance with Shakira — and pick up the latest issue of <a href=# rel=noopener>Us Weekly</a>, on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoJGgtrOtjKKqZpuRqMKiuMuyZJ2ZpJ67qHnLrpqinZ5iuaLCyKyaqK2eqXqpsdJmrZ6qqWK2r8DOZp%2Beql8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./766428-schoolboy-q-builds-anticipation-for-blue-lips-album-expresses-desire-for-jay-z-to-listen.html><span>←</span><span>ScHoolboy Q Builds Anticipation For &amp;quot;Blue Lips&amp;quot; Album, Expresses Desire For Jay-Z To Listen</span></a>

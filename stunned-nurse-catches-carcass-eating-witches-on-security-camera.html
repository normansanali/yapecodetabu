A Canadian nature lover’s attempt to capture wildlife on camera backfired terrifyingly after she inadvertently documented what appeared to be “naked witches eating a carcass” at night right by her house.
Social media posts depicting the alleged deer-crunching coven are currently blowing up online, with viewers speculating the nighttime noshers were conducting some sort of satanic ritual.
“I don’t know what the heck was up with that,” Corinea Stanhope, 36, told Kennedy News of the spine-tingling sight."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Maybe I believe them now.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Stanhope’s camera did catch a bobcat eating the deer carcass. <span class=credit>Kennedy News & Media</span></figure><p>Social media seemed convinced that the Canadian had witnessed witches, a local cult or some other malevolent entity performing a demonic ritual.</p><p>“This is actually terrifying,” commented one viewer, while another posited, “That’s a skinwalker, they look ‘human’ so you come up to them and once you do you’re gone.”</p><p>“That’s basically a walking demon from hell,” theorized a third. “If you hear screaming stay inside and get a gun you leave it alone.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Stanhope and her daughter Ashtyn, 15. <span class=credit>Kennedy News & Media</span></figure><p>One occult lover even postulated that the barenaked ladies were wendigos, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">native American spirits </a>who possess people and turn them into cannibals.</p><p>“This creature has long been known among the Algonquian&nbsp;Ojibwe, Eastern Cree, Saulteaux, Westmain Swampy Cree, Naskapi, and Innu peoples,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reads their description on Legends of America</a>. “They have described them as giants, many times larger than human beings.”</p><p>They added, “Although descriptions can vary somewhat, common to all these cultures is the view that the wendigo is a malevolent, cannibalistic, supernatural being strongly associated with winter, the north, coldness, famine, and starvation.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Commenters had their own theories about who the mysterious carcass munchers were. <span class=credit>Kennedy News & Media</span></figure><p>Some commenters suggested they were part of some demonic cult, according to Stanhope.</p><p>“There’s rumors around town about a cult that collects animal bones. I don’t know if it’s real or not,” she said. “Some people have mentioned it since I posted the photos. A friend said they came across two people in the woods carrying some dead squirrels.”</p><p>A few concerned viewers even urged Stanhope to call the police, which she said she was tempted to do before her grandpa Bob pointed out that the duo wasn’t doing anything “illegal technically.”</p><p>“He was pretty mortified,” said the woman, who hopes that the deer diners were simply pulling a prank.</p><p>“I’m hoping they went for a walk in the day, saw the trail cam was set up and wanted to have a bit of fun with us or they’re on some good drugs,” she said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">“The horses always get really spooked and unnerved around that area,” said Stanhope. “I thought they imagined stuff at first so I didn’t think anything of it.

With that said, their offense was unable to capitalize and therefore were eliminated after a successful regular season and <strong>Wild Card</strong> win against the <a href=#><strong>Bucs</strong></a>.</p><p>As for the Niners, their defense proved again why they are the number one ranked defense in football with an absolute elite-all around showcase. <a href=#><strong>Dak Prescott</strong></a> went from having arguably the best game of his career the week prior, to having arguably one of the worst performances of his career against this elite Niners defense.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Dak-Arik-Armstead.jpg><p>To start with some individuals on this fantastic defensive unit, superstar middle linebacker <a href=#><strong>Fred Warner</strong></a> had an all-pro performance, whether it was stopping the run, covering the middle of the field, or making an essential play in coverage against Cowboys wideout <a href=#><strong>CeeDee Lamb</strong></a>. Warner finished with an interception, nine tackles, a tackle for loss, and a pass deflection against Lamb.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Deommodore-Lenoir-CeeDee-Lamb.jpg><p>Joining Warner was fellow linebacker <a href=#><strong>Azeez Al-Shaair</strong></a> and defensive back <a href=#><strong>Jimmie Ward</strong></a>, with seven tackles apiece; Ward also added two pass deflections and a tackle for loss. Three pass rushers in <a href=#><strong>Samson Ebukam</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Nick Bosa</strong></a>, and <a href=#><strong>Charles Omenihu</strong></a>, combined for four quarterback hits on Prescott. Young defensive back <a href=#><strong>Deommodore Lenoir</strong></a> also showed out in the playoff win as he picked off Prescott, deflected one of his passes, and made five tackles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Fred-Warner-CeeDee-Lamb-Photo-Credit-Michael-Owens-Getty-Images.jpg><p>We can go on and on about the incredible performance of this 49ers defense led by defensive coordinator <a href=#><strong>DeMeco Ryans</strong></a>.</p><p>On the offense, <a href=#><strong>Christian McCaffrey</strong></a> was San Fran‚Äôs lone scorer in the contest as he finished the game with 57 total yards as well; that said, <strong><a href=#>Elijah Mitchell</a></strong> was the 49ers leading runner as he ran fourteen times for 51 yards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Christian-McCaffrey-scaled.jpg><p>Rookie sensation <a href=#><strong>Brock Purdy</strong></a>‚Äôs magical start to his <a href=#><strong>NFL</strong></a> career continues as he is now 7-0 in the first seven starts of his career; the young signal-caller threw for 214 yards, and his top target on the day was tight end, <a href=#><strong>George Kittle</strong></a>. Kittle had a team-high five receptions along with a team-high 95 yards.</p><p>All in all, the Cowboys offense was unable to produce consistently, and the 49ers offense were able to pull out one more successful drive that led to their 19-12 win.</p><p>Significant props should go to 49ers kicker <a href=#><strong>Robbie Gould</strong></a>; <a href=#>Gould</a> is one of the greatest kickers in NFL history and is now 29 for 29 in field goal attempts and 38 for 38 in extra point attempts in his postseason career.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>ROBBIE GOULD IS MONEY <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rqJJJLKFFk</a></p><p>‚Äî NFL on CBS üèà (@NFLonCBS) <a href=#>January 23, 2023</a></p><p>The 49ers will now face off against the Philadelphia Eagles in the <strong>NFC Championship</strong> on Sunday, January 29.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/49ers-Eagles.jpg><p>Let us know what you think about the 49ers eliminating the Cowboys by either leaving a reaction at the bottom of the post or by sending us a tweet at <a href=#>@celebsecrets</a>.</p><h2 class="g1-beta g1-beta-2nd">What's Your Reaction?</h2><span class=ppma-layout-prefix></span> <span class="ppma-category-group ppma-category-group-"><ul class=pp-multiple-authors-boxes-ul><li class="pp-multiple-authors-boxes-li author_index_0 author_rob has-avatar" readability=3.3426124197002><img data-del=avatar alt="Rob Cao" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SELFIE-110x110.jpg height=80 width=80 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="pp-author-boxes-description multiple-authors-description">Rob Cao is a Sports & Sports Culture News & Features Intern for Celeb Secrets.

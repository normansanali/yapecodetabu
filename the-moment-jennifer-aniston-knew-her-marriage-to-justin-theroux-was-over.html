And it was a lot of space. Theroux apparently remained living in his bachelor pad in New York City, while Aniston stayed in their LA home. But when that living arrangement didn't work, Aniston knew it was over.</p><p>Sources told Us Weekly&nbsp;that with their different lifestyles and with the living arrangement, "it became clear they weren't meant to be married." In the same interview, the sources elaborated that Theroux was happy living in New York without Aniston, and that the We're the Millers actress was always "a California girl at heart." They also didn't share the same hobbies, with the American Psycho actor reportedly preferring motorcycles and tattoos, and Aniston being more into yoga and facials.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite Aniston apparently already knowing it was over, they did try a "last-ditch effort" to save their marriage. According to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, the couple took a final trip to Mexico to work things out, but they each ended up spending more time with friends who were on the trip instead of each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma29hZ4F0e9OhnGaln6Kyr8CMo5ynppmbsrN5wKegrKyfo3qsusSwZKGdomK6or7RopignV2pvG621KyroqZdqbWmvs6ur2avkah6sMLEq2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tanisha-thomas-net-worth-bio-son-birthday.html><span>←</span><span>Tanisha Thomas Net Worth 2024 | Tanisha Thomas Bio, Son, Birthday, Weight Loss, Zodiac Sign, Husband</span></a>

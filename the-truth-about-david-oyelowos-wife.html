The two classically trained actors wanted to ensure they dodged all of the "divorce and dysfunction" they witnessed in the acting world. "So much we have done in our life together was mocked," Oyelowo explained. "And to be perfectly frank we're having the last laugh."</p><p>With more than two decades of marriage and four children under their belts, the star of A United Kingdom boasted about how solid his connection is with his wife. "I love my wife even more than I did 24 years ago," he declared. "Our marriage is strong ... because of some of the foundational choices we made early on." As for their two-week rule, Oyelowo noted that, because it works so well, he and Jessica have actually inspired other actors to follow suit. "We've seen other people emulate that, which is the greatest compliment they can pay us," <a href=#>Oyelowo</a> added. Perhaps we could all learn from their profound example!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGhlaoJ4e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2Zrre1w2amsp2cpMSwv4ywoJ%2BdXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-rise-of-dana-whites-power-slap-a-new-era-in-the-world-of-slap-fighting.html><span>←</span><span>The Rise of Dana White's Power Slap: A New Era in the World of Slap Fighting</span></a>

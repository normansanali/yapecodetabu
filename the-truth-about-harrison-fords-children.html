"At weekends we always seemed to go to someone's home, never to a restaurant, for a Sunday roast. I watched everything," he recalled. And while speaking about his mother's influence on his career path, he told <a href=#>Life + Times</a>, "My mother and her friends always involved me in their cooking projects. We also always had a garden and I think those two things were the catalyst for my passion for cooking."</p><p dir=ltr>In 2003, Ben told <a href=#>The Baltimore Sun</a> that his then-3-year-old son, Ethan, was following in his footsteps by helping out in the kitchen "every day." Ethan's mother is Ben's ex-wife, producer&nbsp;Elizabeth Winkler. Ben later married a fellow foodie named Emily, and they welcomed a son named Waylon in 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb25pboZ1e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2drrO%2ByKymp2WWpL%2Blv4ycn6KklKeyr3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1918-flu-pandemic.html><span>←</span><span>Spanish Flu Pandemic Photos That Capture The 1918 Outbreak</span></a>

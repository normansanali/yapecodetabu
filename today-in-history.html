The South Carolina General Assembly voted unanimously to secede, citing that the federal government had failed to uphold its constitutional obligations to the state by “denounc[ing] as sinful the institution of slavery” and assisting “thousands of our slaves to leave their homes.”</p><h2>1924: Adolf Hitler Is Released From Prison</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Adolf Hitler</a> is released from Landsberg Prison after spending nine months incarcerated for his role in the Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, a failed coup against Germany’s government by the Nazi Party. While in prison, the future dictator started writing the first volume of Mein Kampf, his political manifesto. After his release, Hitler quickly helped grow the Nazi Party. Within 10 years, he would be elected the chancellor of Germany.</p><h2>1924: The Cecil Hotel Opens in Los Angeles</h2><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>Cecil Hotel</a> opens in Los Angeles. The hotel was built by William Banks Hanner. It was meant to be a destination hotel for the high-class. Instead of being known as an opulent and luxurious getaway, the Cecil Hotel has a much darker reputation. Since its opening, the hotel has been plagued by bad luck. At least 16 people have been murdered within its walls, and numerous suicides and paranormal activity have been reported. It has even served as the temporary home of many serial killers. In 2013, the Cecil Hotel made headlines once again after Elisa Lam was found naked and deceased in the hotel’s water tanks.</p><h2>1957: Elvis Presley Is Drafted</h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-400088 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/elvis-in-the-army.jpg alt="Elvis In The Army" width=850 height=614 sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-400088 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Elvis Presley while stationed in Germany in 1958.</span></p><p>American singer Elvis Presley receives his draft notice while at Graceland for Christmas. Three months later, he was sworn in as a private in the United States Army. For 18 months, Presley served in the 3rd Armor Division in Friedberg, Germany. He was ultimately promoted to the rank of sergeant. Presley recorded numerous singles before his deployment, which his manager released periodically throughout his time in the army, helping to maintain his music career before he was honorably discharged in 1960.</p><h2>2009: Brittany Murphy Dies</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-400090 alt="Simon Monjack And Brittany Murphy" width=800 height=686 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/simon-monjack-and-brittany-murphy.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-400090 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>John Shearer/WireImage via Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Brittany Murphy with her husband Simon Monjack in November 2007.</span></p><p>American actress <a href=# rel=noopener>Brittany Murphy</a> collapses in her Los Angeles, California home and is rushed to the hospital, where she goes into cardiac arrest and dies.</p><p>An autopsy later found that the 32-year-old had died from pneumonia, iron-deficiency anemia, and multiple drug intoxication from prescription medications. Her husband, <a href=# rel=noopener>Simon Monjack</a>, died under shockingly similar circumstances just five months later, sparking conspiracy theories that toxic mold in their home had caused their deaths. However, this idea was never proven.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1u8OasGahnmK1qr%2FTqKmyZ5SasKa5wZ6pZmpg</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./watch-zooey-deschanel-and-ben-html.html><span>←</span><span>Watch Zooey Deschanel and Ben Schwartz Sing a Sweet Duet</span></a>

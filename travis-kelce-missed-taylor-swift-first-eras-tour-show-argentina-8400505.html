Mahomes's foundation was established in 2019, and is focused on improving the lives of children in underserved communities. The charity confirmed Travis's attendance with a photo of him at the event posted to their Instagram Stories. "@killatrav in the building! Huge thanks for all your support," they wrote in the caption.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>@15andmahomies/Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kelce and the rest of the Chiefs are on their "bye week," which provides them with a brief break from the busy NFL season — and this year, it coincidentally coincides with Swift's debut international Eras Tour performances. Just a day earlier, Travis all but basically confirmed that he would be at Taylor's show while discussing how he would spend his time off on the latest episode of his podcast <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>New Heights</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I might just say fuck it and go somewhere nice. My skin's getting real pale, so I've got to go someplace sunny," Travis said. "Some place south, closer to the equator."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Travis still has time to make it down to Buenos Aires. While Taylor might have kicked off the international leg of her tour on Thursday, she still has three more nights in the Argentinean city before heading to Rio de Janeiro next week.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, if he doesn't end up coming, Traylor apparently has other plans for making their long-distance relationship work. “Travis and Taylor are a very real couple, they actually spend a lot of one-on-one time together and have developed a very real connection,” a source previously told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Us Weekly</a>, adding: “They have very detailed plans coming up on how to stay together while she’s on tour and he has games.” TBD on what those plans actually are.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5706uYr6GjYrimuMKeZKaho6iypXnTmrClp6JiwLi1xa1kn6GiqMFusdGaqmasn6q%2Fbr%2FHqK5mmaKcsq%2FAyKeYZnBkZX12fJQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chelsea-handler-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Chelsea Handler Net Worth 2024</span></a>

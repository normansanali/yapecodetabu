While doctors have known about the dietary benefits of the vitamin for centuries — if you're anything like me, your public school education really emphasized its role in curing scurvy — serums touting the ingredients only really took off in the last 10 years. And thanks to products like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tula Skincare's Triple Vitamin C Serum</a>, a decade barely leaves its mark on skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The antioxidant activity of vitamin C protects against UV-induced damage caused by free radicals, which will prevent accelerated aging and skin cancer," board-certified dermatologist Dr. Michelle Henry previously told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle</a>. "It also boosts firmness by regulating collagen production." The effects extend to lightening dark spots and hyperpigmentation, Dr. Henry says, since the vitamin interferes with the enzymes used in melanin production.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The challenge is going from thinking, "I should try a vitamin C serum!" to facing down the plethora of options and forms of it available. There are 171 vitamin C serums at Sephora, and an overwhelming 7,000 stocked on Amazon — but Tula's cuts through the clutter with three forms of vitamin C, probiotics, and a time-release formula.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$48; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">tula.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Predominant in the Triple Vitamin C Serum is 3-O-ethyl ascorbic acid, which <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Incidecoder.com</a> terms a "very stable and promising form of the skincare superstar." Since it dissolves in both oil and water, it deeply penetrates skin to deliver results. Ascorbyl glucoside follows it, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">a stable take on the ingredient</a> that ensures your serum won't oxidize and lose its power before you've finished the bottle. Last but not least, vitamin C's OG form, ascorbic acid, also lends its help as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">most potent form of vitamin C</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Twelve plant extracts, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>turmeric</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">lingonberry extract</a>, add another boost of antioxidants, as do <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nocaes>gold</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">glutathione</a>. Lactic acid finishes off the mix with a light dose of exfoliating alpha hydroxy acid, for a multi-faceted formula that's garnered hundreds of five-star reviews.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In just a week, I'm already seeing a huge difference in my skin," writes one shopper working through severe breakouts. "With this serum and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the 24-7 moisturizer</a>, my skin is clearing up and noticeably more clear, even toned, and fine lines are subsiding." Another person saw just as satisfying results in a week, describing how their dull, sun-damaged skin and dark spots turned a corner and became much more even as fine lines disappeared.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Even though everyone says I look 25, my skin has lines and dark spots, so I decided to start a real regimen," says a shopper in the 35 to 44 age range. "I added this in the morning and before bed, and all I can say is WOW! One week… that's it, ONE WEEK and my skin is so soft, even and bright, so much younger and healthier looking."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They continued: "Is that even possible? All the dark spots are fading, [and] my lines, dark spots and dark circles are almost gone. This can't be real, right? Gonna go <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">buy more Tula products now</a> because I'm obsessed with how many years this shaved off of my face."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The brightening effects alone have won the serum almost two dozen glowing reviews (pun intended), with fans discussing the "incredible" difference they've seen in radiance. The changes kicked in after just a few days, some say, thanks to the impressive formula. "I noticed results right away," writes a final person in the 55 to 64 age range. "This product's clean ingredients is a big reason why, I believe — my face has improved pigmentation, a youthful glow and [is] much smoother to the touch."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Big results from the turquoise jar</a>, and best of all, there's no brass penny smell (or hot dog water, depending on interpretation). All pros, no cons: It's like an anti-aging heist gone right.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1oq66kkWLBs7XPpZxmrpmprq61zWaaZquVp8KuedSlq5plYmZ6pa3YrGSbnZGqwbp50pqjng%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nyyxxii-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-55142-html.html><span>←</span><span>Nyyxxii Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>

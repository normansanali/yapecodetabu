Despite having access to all the top designers and stylists, there’s one thing that’s super important. What may that be? Comfort — more specifically, comfy attire. In this case, we’re talking about clothes and accessories that are so good, we never want to take them off!</p><p>And what’s one particularly cozy item on our mind? UGGs. Yes, the fan-favorite brand is making a major comeback and Hollywood has seriously started to take notice. From <strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong> to<strong> Khloe Kardashian</strong> to <strong>Cardi B,</strong> it’s the comfy-chic shoe celebrities are completely obsessed with. In fact, the Bodak Yellow singer didn’t just love <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">this slipper for herself —</a> she even splurged and grabbed a pair for her daughter, <strong>Kulture</strong>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Fluffy-Slipper-Uggs.jpg><p>UGG Fluff Yeah Slippers</p><a href=# rel=sponsored class=shopping-button__link></a><p>We’re all about a good mommy-and-me moment! So when we happened to notice these two totally twinning, we were practically speechless. In a recent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> photo, Cardi B captured the sweetest #footsie (foot selfie!) of her and Kulture rocking identical fluffy slippers. If anyone else is like Us and wants to steal their style, we’re all in luck. We found the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">UGG Fluff Yeah Slippers </a>available for purchase at this very moment.</p><p>Honestly, it’s hard to resist how captivating these slippers are. While it’s obviously tempting to rock Cardi’s signature fuchsia, there are 13 other available shades. The navy multi and multi are both excellent options for anyone who’s looking for more than one pop of color, while black and white remain strong choices for everyday essentials. Reviewers couldn’t get over how “gorgeous” each and every shade was, and many of them went back “for more than one pair.” Now, who can blame them? Not Us, especially since this extremely flattering slipper features the same dreamy design throughout each and every version.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/UGG-Fluffy-Yeah-Slipper.jpg> <a href=# rel=sponsored class=shopping-button__link></a><p>We can’t get over how comfortable this slipper not only looks but will undoubtedly feel. The signature UGG sheepskin interior is now updated. Instead of being solely featured on the interior, it’s also present on the exterior. The verdict? Perfection. We’re talking not just a fan-favorite, but a five-star-rated fan-favorite! Over 1,300 reviewers could not get over how “comfortable” and “wearable” this slipper was. One reviewer said it was like “walking on a cloud,” and another loved how the slipper “hugged her feet [with] comfort.”</p><p>Just when we thought these slippers couldn’t get any better, we noticed the jumbo strap on the back. This dainty detail will keep our feet locked in safe and sound with each and every step we take. With all these great features, we can completely understand why this Cardi B-approved <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">slipper</a> is a necessary new addition to anyone’s collection!</p><p><strong>See it: Grab a pair of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">UGG Fluff Yeah Slippers</a> for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$100,</a>&nbsp;available at Zappos!&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Not your style?

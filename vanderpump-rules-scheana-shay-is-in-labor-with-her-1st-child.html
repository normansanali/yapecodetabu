I first found out I was pregnant last May, which sadly ended in a miscarriage the following month. Just 5 weeks later, I was blessed with my rainbow baby,” she <a href=#>wrote</a> on Tuesday, April 20. “To the baby I lost, thank you for showing me how badly I wanted to be a mom and I truly believe you will come back to me in my next pregnancy. To my rainbow baby girl, thank you for blessing me with the most amazing pregnancy I ever could’ve imagined. Not one day of morning sickness, filled with energy, and although the heartburn has been real, I wouldn’t have it any other way. I cannot wait to hold you in my arms and I will always and forever protect you.”</p><p>The “Good&nbsp;as Gold” singer <a href=#>announced her pregnancy</a> in October 2020 after opening up about her <a href=#>fertility journey</a> on Vanderpump Rules.

The world knew him as the lead singer and guitarist of the metal band Static-X. The main source of his net worth was the albums the band had released of which one was certified Platinum. His career in the music industry began in 1987, and ended with his premature death.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Wayne Static was before he died? According to sources, it was estimated that Wayne Static`s total net worth was $1 million, an amount earned through his successful career as a musician. Other than his involvement with the band Static X, he also managed to release a solo album before he died in 2014, entitled “Pighammer”.</p><h3>Wayne Static Net Worth $1 Million</h3><p>Wayne spent his childhood days in Shelby, Michigan, where he graduated from the Shelby High School, before eventually moving to Chicago in order to pursue his career as a musician. He fell in love with guitars and their sounds when he got his first guitar at the age of seven; he started taking classes and a year later he won his first contest. After graduation from high school and a move to Chicago, Wayne soon entered the music industry. His first band, Deep Blue Dream, was founded in 1987, and featured musicians Ken Jay, Eric Harris and Billy Corgan, who would later become the founding members of the “Smashing Pumpkins”. The band did not last long, as it broke-up at the beginning of the 90s, when Wayne moved to California.</p><p>Nevertheless, Wayne continued to dig deeper into the music industry and in 1994 founded the Static-X band, with Tony Campos and Koichi Fukuda. In 1999, the band released their debut album “Wisconsin Death Trip” through Warner Bros records; the album was a major success, as it was certified platinum in 2001. Following this success, the band released five more albums over the years before their break-up in 2010, with revenue from sales becoming the main source of Wayne`s overall net worth. The second album was released in 2001, entitled “Machine”, which peaked at 11th spot on the Billboard top 200 and sold over 500,000 copies. Their album from 2003 entitled “Shadow Zone” featured a single “The Only” that was used in the video game “Need For Speed: Underground” soundtrack. Their last album entitled “Cult Of Static” was released in 2009, and positively influenced Wayne`s net worth because it peaked at the 16th spot on the Billboard Top 200 chart. The album featured the single “Lunatic” which was used on the soundtrack of the video game “Punisher: War Zone”. However, the band broke up in 2010, due to an argument between members over the rights of the band.</p><p>Nevertheless, Wayne continued his engagement in the music industry, releasing a solo album in 2011 entitled “Pighammer” and touring through most of the 2012 and 2013 which also benefited his net worth. He was also scheduled to play on a tour with the band “Powerman 5000” through the November 2014.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, he has been recognized as a vegetarian; however, his life had a dark side. He was known for his drug abuse, which would cost him his life. Apparently, on the morning of the November 1st, he took an oxycodone pill together with alcohol, before he went to sleep. His wife, Tera, to whom he had been married since 2008, later found that he had died during his sleep. The autopsy showed that he had a critical dose of mixed substances including, oxycodone, alprazolam and alcohol. Wayne was cremated in California, and a tribute concert was held in his honor.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=15.021582733813><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Wayne Static</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1 Million</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 4, 1965, Muskegon, Michigan, United States</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Died</td><td>November 1, 2014, Landers, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Muskegon</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, Guitarist</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Western Michigan University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Tera Wray (m. 2008–2014)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Parents</td><td>Richard Wells, Darlene Wells, Assassins of Youth, Not Meant for Me, Static Killer</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nicknames</td><td>Wayne Static of Static-X , Static, Wayne , Wayne Richard Wells</td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1413618</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Music Groups</td><td>Static‐X (1994 – 2013), Pigface</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>His gravity-defying hair</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=11.5625><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2.6712328767123><td>1</td><td>Touring in support of <a href=#>Static-X</a>'s latest album, "Shadow Zone".

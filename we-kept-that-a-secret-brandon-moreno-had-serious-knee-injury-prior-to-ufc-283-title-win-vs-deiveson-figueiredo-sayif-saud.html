Brandon hurt his knee really badly and we kept that a secret. Nobody knew about it, and not only did he have all of those other things to deal with, but physically [as well].”</p><p>“He got really sick last month. He got that flu [that was going around] and for two weeks, he was so sick. He would do rounds, hack s*** up, blow his nose, and, ‘Yes sir, yes sir,’ but he was struggling,” he continued, “It was serious. It popped, but this guy would fight with one leg. There was never a time in Brandon’s mind that he wasn’t fighting. That’s the spirit of a champion.”</p><h2>How Brandon Moreno vs Deiveson Figueiredo 4 could’ve gone terribly wrong!</h2><p>Even if we leave Moreno’s injuries leading up to the fight aside, ‘The Assassin Baby’ suffered through a lot. First, his head coach <a href=# rel=noopener>James Krause got suspended by the UFC for suspicious betting activity</a>. Later it was revealed around one month before Moreno’s championship fight that, no fighter trained by Krause would be allowed to compete unless they found a new coach.</p><p>On the other hand, fighting with the flu or hiding a physical injury wouldn’t probably be a good idea either. T.J. Dillashaw fought his last fight against Aljamain Sterling with a shoulder injury and promptly lost. Bryce Mitchell on the other hand did poorly against Ilia Topuria and blamed the flu for his performance.</p><p>Who do you want to see Moreno fight next?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6usspmku2%2BvzqZmsJ1doLKxwIytn5qsXZZ6tLHCq5ytZZKnrq%2Bwzqdkpqeimruweceam2arlae2sMHSZqKnnZVitq%2B21KuwZqiinryzedOoZK6ek2J%2FeX%2BMraCtpJVixKq6jK%2BqZpyVnsOmv86nZJ%2Bhl6qyqr7EnaZmq5Gutqd50pqsnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./intel-unveils-avx10-and-apx-isas-unifying-avx512-for-hybrid-architectures.html><span>←</span><span>Unifying AVX-512 For Hybrid Architectures</span></a>

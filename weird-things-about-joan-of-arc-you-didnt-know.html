After her death, neighbors testified that Joan's father was a "doyden" or senior inhabitant of the village, which means he was next to the mayor in importance. The family were landholders — they had 20 acres, including farmland, meadow, and forest. They also had money stashed away for emergencies, which is a lot more than many modern families can claim to have.</p><p>In fact Joan's family doesn't appear to have been suffering at all — their annual income was said to be the equivalent of roughly 200 pounds, which was kind of a lot of money in those days — enough to live comfortably, raise kids, and give a little bit to the actual poor.</p><p>So what gives with the "poor peasant" stuff? It might have something to do with the whole underdog thing — it's much nicer to imagine a poor girl becoming the heroine of France than it is to imagine a well-off girl doing the same thing. It's definitely better for public morale, too, especially when the average family in those days tended to be more poor than not.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kmppcnFfrLKqvsNmq6GhnpzAbq3BqKytZZqkrq95zp9kmqqTYsawwYydoJ2mpGK4r7vWaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tracy-morgan-and-megan-wollover-headed-for-divorce-after-nearly-5-years-of-marriage.html><span>←</span><span>TRACY MORGAN AND MEGAN WOLLOVER HEADED FOR DIVORCE AFTER NEARLY 5 YEARS OF MARRIAGE</span></a>

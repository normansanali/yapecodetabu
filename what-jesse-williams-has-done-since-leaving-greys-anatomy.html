The show is centered around Meredith Grey and her work at a hospital which has changed names countless times. Grey is surrounded by her co-workers and friends, who also change so often it’s hard to keep track even for the most dedicated viewers and fans. Actors and actresses come on to the show for long periods of time before eventually moving on to work on other projects. This was the case for actor Jesse Williams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Williams played Jackson Avery on the show Grey’s Anatomy. He was a part of the hit television show for over a decade before he decided it was time to move on. Now, Williams is trying out new projects and dealing with dramatic personal issues. Here’s what Jesse Williams has done since leaving Grey’s Anatomy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Leaving Grey’s Anatomy Was A Good Decision For Sandra Oh</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-jesse-williams><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Who Is Jesse Williams?</span></h2><p>Jesse Williams is an actor best known for his work on the hit ABC show Grey’s Anatomy. He joined the cast of the television show in its sixth season, though it was unclear for how long Williams would be a part of the cast. Williams played Jackson Avery for 12 years <a href=#>before saying goodbye to the show in 2021</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Williams married Aryn Drake-Lee in 2012. Before then, they were together for many years. They have two children together, Sadie and Maceo, but they ended their over a decade long relationship in 2017. Their divorce was officially finalized in 2020 after three years of messy negotiations.</p><h2 id=why-did-jessie-williams-leave-greys-anatomy><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Why Did Jessie Williams Leave Greys Anatomy?</span></h2><p>Many actors and actresses have come and gone from the cast of Grey’s Anatomy. Hardly any of the original cast members from 2005 remain a part of the hit television show. Jesse Williams joined the show in its sixth season and left after season 17. He did make a guest appearance at the end of season 18 to reveal that his character and April Kepner had gotten back together while the two lived in Boston.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After playing the same character for over a decade, Williams was more than ready to tackle new challenges and try new things. He thought his characters exit “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">felt organic</a>” and that it was time to say goodbye to his character Jackson Avery.</p><h2 id=jesse-williams-plays-a-super-villain><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jesse Williams Plays A Super Villain</span></h2><p>Considering Jesse Williams played Jackson Avery on Grey’s Anatomy for over a decade, it is no surprise he wanted to take on new and different roles. For the streaming service Paramount +, Williams played the part of Irons.</p><p>The streaming service original movie is called Secret Headquarters. The film is geared towards children and features Owen Wilson as a superhero. Williams plays a villain, which is very different than his character in Grey’s Anatomy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is Jesse William’s Net Worth Following ‘Grey’s Anatomy’?</a></span></p><h2 id=jesse-williams-voice-acted-for-a-video-game><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jesse Williams Voice Acted For A Video Game</span></h2><p>While moving on from Grey’s Anatomy, Jesse Williams wanted to try a different kind of acting.

In the game, he acted as the player’s father. Williams’s character in the basketball game even looked just like him. Fans weren’t used to seeing Williams tackle these types of projects. <a href=#>Many actors are deeply invested in video games</a>, so it was natural for Williams to want to try something new.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jesse-williams-started-directing><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jesse Williams Started Directing</span></h2><p>Acting is not the only aspect of the entertainment industry that Jesse Williams has interest in.

Their divorce was messy and complicated, causing it to not be legally finalized until October 2020. Their initial agreement was 50-50 custody of their children with Williams paying $40,000 a month for child support.</p><p>Now, however, Drake-Lee is going for sole custody of Sadie and Maceo with Williams only having certain visitation rights. This is due to Drake-Lee’s claim that Williams has not complied with the court’s ruling and <a href=#>consistently skips his custody time</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:</span><a href=#><span class=related-single>Jesse Williams’ Co-Parenting Situation With His Ex-Wife Seems Messy And Downright Confusing</span></a></p><h2 id=ex-wife-claims-jesse-williams-has-changed-since-leaving-greys-anatomy><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ex-Wife Claims Jesse Williams Has Changed Since Leaving Greys Anatomy</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans of Jesse Williams are used to seeing the kind-hearted man from interviews, but his ex-wife tells a different story of his character.

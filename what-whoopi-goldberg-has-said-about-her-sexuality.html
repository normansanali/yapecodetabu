On the show, Raven Simone made a surprising admission regarding their time as "The View" co-hosts. "I loved you so much, like I just wanted to be up underneath the t***y the whole time," she said of Goldberg, before adding, "But that's also because you just kind of gave me lesbian vibes!'"</p><p>Simone assured Goldberg that she was free to admit whatever she wanted, but the EGOT winner took it as an opportunity to clear up longstanding rumors about her sexuality instead. "Women have been asking me this for as long as I've been around. I am not a lesbian. But I know lots of them, and I've played them on television," Goldberg said, noting that she has several lesbian friends and had set boundaries with them. "I'm not gonna kiss you, but I'll kiss you over here. I'll do this, but I'm not going to do this,'" she explained. "And they're like, 'OK!'"</p><p>To be fair to Goldberg, it's not like she ever attempted to hide her true sexuality. She's <a href=#>only had public relationships and marriages with men</a>&nbsp;and maintained it was never her intention to come across as vague. "I'm pretty clear," she said in the Pride Source interview. "You've never seen me with a woman. Pretty much been married to men the whole time! Not the same, but a few of them. ... Nah, I'm straight, but what does it mean? What does it really mean?"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtnbIB1fY6wn5qsXay1sLvPomSgp5yZr6a%2BxmafmqtdqK6qsIyamaitpGK1pr6MrJyxrZGhtrXFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./worst-10-horror-movies-2012.html><span>←</span><span>The 13 Worst Horror Movies Of 2012</span></a>

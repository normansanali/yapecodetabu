It turns out Sam comes from quite an industrious family, and all of his siblings have made their own way in the world, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The question that fans may have, knowing how strained Britney's relationships with her family have been, is whether Sam Asghari's family is supportive of his marriage. Does Sam's family like Britney, and do they all get along?</p><h2 id=sam-asghari-is-one-of-four-children>Sam Asghari Is One Of Four Children</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/britney-spears-and-sam-asghari.jpg><p>Sam Asghari, born Hesam Asghari, is the youngest of four kids, with the rest being girls. While the family seems supportive of one another, Sam and his dad moved to the United States; Mike Asghari first, his son later at age 12.</p><p>Sam's sisters stayed in Tehran with his mom Fatima, though the family was later reunited. In interviews, Sam has talked about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how much his family means to him</a>, and what they sacrificed to ensure he had more opportunities than they did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Men's Health, Sam shared, "When great things happen to me, it only motivates me and puts me in a position where I have to work even harder. I think about how far my family came, and everything they sacrificed for me to be here, so I never take anything for granted."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Britney Spears And Sam Asghari’s Relationship As Perfect As It Seems?</a></span></p><p>Asghari elaborated that while Spears is an inspiration to him, as she is so humble despite everything she has accomplished in life, it's always been his priority to support his family. At the time, in 2018, Sam and Britney weren't married yet—and much of her conservatorship was still under wraps.</p><p>For Sam, a deeper connection was already there; "I grew up with three sisters, and my personality is just to be a supportive person for my family and she’s family. I’m always going to support her. She is another blessing that happened to me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-are-sam-asghari-39-s-sisters>Who Are Sam Asghari's Sisters?</h2><p>Two of Sam's sisters are lesser known; fewer details are available about Maddie or Ellie, but Fay is a social media personality. In fact, Sam's sister Fay helped him get his first modeling gig.</p><p>The story goes that Fay was close friends with fashion designer Michael Costello, and after Sam's personal trainer transformation, she suggested her brother model for Costello.</p><p>It worked out, and got Sam in front of the larger industry, leading to additional opportunities—including a gig working with Britney Spears.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Sam Asghari Making Britney Spears' Family Feud Worse?</a></span></p><p>Fay Asghari's social media explains that she's an entrepreneur, nurse practitioner, and model. She's also the founder of Spa Medica Aesthetic, a cosmetic treatment office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maddie Asghari also works in the industry, and she's a registered nurse in addition to holding the same cosmetic injector certification as her sister. Though Maddie's social media following isn't as strong as Fay's, the pair appear to work together and support one another.</p><p>Ellie, the third Asghari sister, doesn't appear to have public social media accounts and appears to fly under the radar. A LinkedIn account possibly belonging to Ellie suggests she's a forensic scientist.</p><p>Ellie might keep quiet online, but she did make one notable appearance on her sister Fay's social media.</p><h2 id=sam-asghari-39-s-sisters-attended-his-wedding-to-britney-spears>Sam Asghari's Sisters Attended His Wedding To Britney Spears</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/-EDQ9RuflGPgChU2wXP_5kFKt7ogRaAqTbaalp23rdY.jpeg><p>When Sam Asghari and Britney Spears tied the knot in 2022, all eyes were on their guest list. It was rumored that <a href=#>Britney's family was absolutely banned from attending</a>, though there was also speculation that people who were invited simply didn't show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Spears' ex-husband Jason Alexander attempted to crash the pair's nuptials, fans assumed the worst. But the day seemed to go off without a hitch (<a href=#>once Jason was arrested and jailed</a>), and plenty of people showed up to support the happy couple.</p><p>Three notable attendees? Sam Asghari's sisters, who sat in the row ahead of Madonna and absolutely stole the show.</p><h2 id=did-sam-asghari-39-s-parents-attend-his-wedding>Did Sam Asghari's Parents Attend His Wedding?</h2><p>While it seems Sam Asghari and Britney Spears have his family's support, it's unclear whether Fatima and Mike Asghari attended their son's wedding. Even Page Six, which had exclusive images of Britney's reception, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">couldn't confirm who exactly had attended</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Britney Spears' Sons Snub Her Wedding To Sam Asghari?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">snapshot of the wedding that featured Fay Asghari</a> and, presumably, her sisters as well as another woman (possibly Sam's mother) and man, sitting in the row in front of Madonna, Fay wrote, "One of the most beautiful and emotional moments of my life was to watch my brother get married 😭🥰❤️ I love you both so much @samasghari & @britneyspears"</p><p>Despite the many commenters suggesting the wedding was "fake" and that Asghari's sisters were unimportant (some suggested they should have sat in the back), it seemed Britney and Sam were thrilled with their wedding and, so far, their marriage.</p><p>Plus, there's another explanation for why Sam's parents weren't present at his wedding, and it has nothing to do with Britney at all. Despite the Men's Health interview where Sam praised his parents, Daily Mail suggests <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam's dad moved to the US to marry someone else</a>, and later abandoned his kids.</p><p>Sam confirmed on social media that he hadn't seen his dad in ages, though his mom had met Britney and "loves her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuv8CmZJqrl52us7WMn5imoZyueqO%2ByK2lnrFdqL2mrdGsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-to-watch-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-2023.html><span>←</span><span>Where to watch the 2023 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade</span></a>

Armando Alejandro Montalvo has frequently snuck onto the grounds at WWE’s Orlando facility. He has also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">made complete mockery</a> of attempts by the legal system to rein him in.</p><p>The stalker recently traveled to Kissimmee, Florida, where Impact Wrestling was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">holding its “Citrus Brawl” television tapings</a>. In a Facebook live stream, he attempted to invade the event. In the fourteen-minute clip, he aimlessly wandered around the arena. Montalvo was wearing a bright yellow safety vest with no shirt as he attempted to get himself booked for a match.</p><p>“So, we’re over here to see if we can get a match booked in. If not, we showed up from Orange County, hopefully, to see if we can get a match over here before the end of the night considering we got shot in front of the WWE Performance Center and we’ve been doing our best to try to turn this thing around.”</p><p>The stalker spoke to security personnel at the venue. They explained to him that this was not how wrestling matches were booked. When he was told that, he asked the security guards to put him in handcuffs.</p><p>Montalvo was asked to leave if he didn’t have a ticket. He continued to rant about how this was his redemption. Then, he asked the guard to buy him a ticket before leaving. You can check out the entire bizarre scene in the video below.</p><p><strong>What do you think of this story?
